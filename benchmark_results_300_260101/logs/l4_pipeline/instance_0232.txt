Patient Note:
A 78-year-old man was brought to the hospital by his home-health nurse late this morning because of sudden onset enlargement of his left lower extremity that he first noticed while transferring from bed to his recliner the prior evening. He reported that the whole limb—from the groin through the ankle—looked “puffy” and felt heavy when he tried to pivot, forcing him to drag the leg while using his rollator. He denied falling, twisting the knee, sustaining any direct blow, or developing a skin abrasion, and he had not experienced fever, chills, rash, or erysipelas-like warmth. His medical background is notable for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed nine months earlier; he remains on a bi-weekly gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel regimen, with his most recent infusion five days ago, and imaging two months earlier had demonstrated stable hepatic lesions without new disease. Two years ago he suffered an incomplete L4 spinal cord infarction that left him with residual 3+/5 motor strength in the left hip flexors and knee extensors and brisk patellar reflexes; he wears an articulated ankle-foot orthosis during the day but no cast or rigid splint, and although he ambulates slowly he completes short household distances several times per day, including climbing three steps to reach the porch, so he has not been confined to bed or a chair for prolonged periods. He has never had a clot in the legs or lungs, has no known thrombophilia, and takes no anticoagulant medication. His regular drugs include long-acting oxycodone for oncologic pain, metoprolol for rate control of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a proton-pump inhibitor; he does not use estrogenic compounds, corticosteroids, or erythropoietin stimulators. There is no family history of venous thromboembolism, and he quit smoking 25 years ago. On review of systems he denied new cough, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, palpitations, abdominal distention, urinary retention, or constipation. Vital signs at triage were blood pressure 126/70 mm Hg, heart rate 94 beats/minute and irregularly irregular, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, temperature 36.8 °C, and oxygen saturation 97 % while breathing ambient air. He appeared frail but hemodynamically stable, answering questions in full sentences without dyspnea. Cardiac auscultation revealed an irregular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and lung fields were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no dullness on percussion. Abdominal examination showed a well-healed midline laparotomy scar and mild epigastric tenderness related to tumor burden but no organomegaly or ascites. Inspection of the lower extremities demonstrated a striking global enlargement of the entire left leg compared with the right; the thigh circumference measured at mid-femur was 57 cm on the left versus 52 cm on the right, and the calf circumference taken 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity was 40 cm on the left and 38 cm on the right, yielding a 2 cm discrepancy. The skin over the affected limb was smooth, taut, and slightly warmer than the contralateral side, yet there was no appreciable indentation after firm thumb pressure over the anterior tibia and dorsum of the foot, suggesting absence of meaningful pitting. Color remained normal without streaking or mottling, and no engorged superficial venous channels were visible along the thigh or calf. Palpation elicited a diffuse sense of pressure throughout the limb but did not localize to a cord-like structure along the femoral, popliteal, or posterior tibial tracks; ankle dorsiflexion produced only his baseline neuropathic tightness. Distal perfusion was intact with posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally and capillary refill less than two seconds. Sensory examination showed diminished pinprick below the L4 dermatome on the left, consistent with prior spinal injury, but no new sensory loss. Manual muscle testing revealed unchanged baseline weakness of the left quadriceps while right-sided strength remained 5/5 throughout. Gait could not be assessed during the encounter because he was transported by wheelchair. Laboratory studies drawn before any treatment showed hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, platelet count 268 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count 6.8 × 10⁹/L, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.1; serum electrolytes and liver enzymes were within his known chronic baseline. A plain radiograph of the femur obtained in the emergency department showed no lytic lesions or fracture that might account for the swelling. Given the unilateral, full-length enlargement of the limb without a convincing musculoskeletal or infectious etiology, the presence of an active malignancy, and chronic paresis of the same extremity, the index of suspicion for an obstructive process within the deep venous system is high, and vascular ultrasound of the entire left leg has been requested; therapeutic decisions will await definitive imaging because of concern for gastrointestinal bleeding risk with anticoagulation in the setting of pancreatic cancer.

Question: What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
