Patient Note:
A 41-year-old female patient with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, cocaine use disorder, and tobacco use disorder, presented with increased respiratory distress and combativeness. On initial examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 100.9°F, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg. On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).
She was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (µL) that trended to 2.2 x 103/µL, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).
Sputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).
A repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts. The family eventually decided to transition to comfort care due to her poor prognosis.

Question: What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
