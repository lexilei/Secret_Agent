Patient Note:
A 40-year-old female with a 5-year history of opium abuse presented with 6-month history of fatigue, low back pain, and menometrorrhagia. She had no previous history of any specific medical condition. Physical examination was normal and no abdominal tenderness, organ enlargement, or palpable masses were identified.
Laboratory tests revealed an elevated ESR (70 mm/h) and anemia with hemoglobin of 10.2. Urine analysis was normal. Serum creatinine was elevated (2.5). The tumor markers (CEA, CA125, LDH, αFP, and βHCG) were within normal limits. The results of the other biochemical screenings and electrolyte tests were all within normal range.
Ultrasonography revealed bilateral moderate hydronephrosis without ureteral dilation. On abdominal and pelvic CT, fibrotic tissue was observed surrounding the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries at the level of the sacral promontory. A double-J stent was inserted and the patient began taking an NSAID (ibuprofen 400 mg q 8 h) and prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for approximately 6 weeks. She was also advised to stop using opium. After 9 months, the NSAID and prednisolone were tapered off, and improvements in the patient’s clinical manifestation and radiologic and laboratory findings were observed.

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
