Patient Note:
A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL
Leukocyte count 13,900/mm3
Platelet count 342,000/mm3
Serum
Albumin 2.6 g/dL
Total bilirubin 2.56 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 54 U/L
AST 17 U/L
ALT 44 U/L
Paracentesis is performed. Ascitic fluid analysis shows an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, glucose concentration of 62 mg/dL, and a leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
