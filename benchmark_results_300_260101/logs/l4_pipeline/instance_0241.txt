Patient Note:
A 72-year-old man was seen in the pre-operative assessment clinic this morning for evaluation prior to tomorrow’s planned infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which is being undertaken electively after interval radiologic surveillance documented enlargement of the aneurysmal sac from 5.4 cm to 6.2 cm over the past year. He reports progressive abdominal pulsation awareness but no acute abdominal or back pain, and he specifically denies fevers, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, syncope, or exertional dyspnea. The patient’s cardiovascular history is notable for a myocardial infarction seven years ago that was managed with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and drug-eluting stent placement to the proximal left anterior descending artery; he has experienced no further episodes of chest discomfort since that time, and he remains on low-dose aspirin, high-intensity atorvastatin, and a long-acting beta-blocker. He follows regularly with cardiology, last stress study eighteen months ago was negative for inducible ischemia, and his baseline functional capacity is estimated at 6–7 METs as he ambulates two flights of stairs and performs routine yard work without limitation. He has longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 58, controlled with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and a sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; he has never used injectable glucose-lowering agents and finger-stick glucose logs provided today range from 105–160 mg/dL. There is no personal history of cerebrovascular accident or transient neurologic deficits, and no episodes of claudication, limb ischemia, or heart failure decompensation have been documented. Additional medical problems include stage 3a chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease related to remote tobacco use (quit fifteen years ago, 30 pack-year history), and controlled essential hypertension managed with lisinopril and amlodipine. The patient consumes minimal alcohol, denies illicit drug use, and lives independently with his spouse. Family history is significant for coronary disease in both parents in their 60s but none for aneurysmal disease. Vital signs in clinic: blood pressure 138/72 mm Hg, heart rate 58 beats/min in sinus rhythm, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 97% on room air, temperature 36.6 °C, body mass index 27 kg/m². Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs; peripheral pulses are palpable and symmetric. Lungs are clear bilaterally without wheeze or crackles. Abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable expansile mass in the midline; no bruit is appreciated. Extremities show no edema; capillary refill is brisk. Neurologic assessment is nonfocal, cranial nerves II–XII grossly intact, strength 5/5 throughout. Pre-operative laboratory data obtained this morning demonstrate hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, hematocrit 40%, white blood cell count 6.1 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 210 × 10⁹/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, chloride 101 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, which is consistent with his documented baseline over the previous six months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI is 42 mL/min/1.73 m². Fasting glucose is 132 mg/dL and HbA1c last checked two weeks ago by his primary physician was 7.1%. Electrocardiogram today shows normal sinus rhythm at 56 beats/min with Q-waves in the anterior leads consistent with prior infarction, no acute ST-T changes, and a normal QTc. Chest radiograph reveals clear lung fields, normal cardiac silhouette, and no pulmonary congestion. Pulmonary function testing on file demonstrates an FEV1 of 80% predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.72 without significant bronchodilator responsiveness. The anesthesia team has reviewed the airway and predicts Mallampati class II, thyromental distance 7 cm, full range of neck motion. NPO instructions have been reiteratively provided, and home beta-blocker will be administered the morning of surgery with a sip of water per protocol. Aspirin will be continued, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor will be held today and the morning of surgery to mitigate any peri-operative euglycemic ketoacidosis risk; metformin will be withheld on the day of surgery given renal function. Cross-matched blood products are reserved. After extensive counseling covering surgical approach, expected recovery, potential complications including bleeding, myocardial ischemia, renal injury, pulmonary compromise, and wound infection, the patient verbalized understanding and consents to proceed. No new changes in cardiopulmonary status were elicited during today’s visit, and he will be admitted directly to the surgical floor tomorrow morning for pre-incision preparation and cardiac telemetry monitoring.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
