Patient Note:
A 36-year-old woman underwent a laparoscopic partial hepatectomy for HCC (20 mm in diameter) in liver segment 5 two and a half years ago during follow-up after having been identified as a hepatitis B virus carrier. She has been treated for hepatitis B with nucleoside analogue before the hepatectomy. A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC was subsequently established. We followed up at interval of 2–3 months after the hepatectomy. During post-surgery follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography detected a 36-mm hypoechoic tumor in segment 7 of the liver. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 40-mm tumor adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right hepatic vein (RHV). The tumor was well enhanced in the arterial phase and washed out in the portal venous and delayed phases, suggesting HCC recurrence (Fig. ). No nodule suggesting HCC was identified elsewhere in the liver. Neither lymph-node swelling nor metastasis to other organs was detected. The following laboratory data were obtained: white blood cell count (3000/µL), hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), platelet count (16.5 × 104/µL), C-reactive protein (2.98 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (9.2 mg/dL), creatinine (0.51 mg/dL), total protein (6.3 g/dL), albumin (3.1 g/dL), total bilirubin (0.4 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (28 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (30 IU/L), glutamyltransferase (16 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (179 U/L), alkaliphosphatase (192 U/L), prothrombin time (115.3%), and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (7.0%). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) (12,371.5 ng/mL; normal range < 10 ng/mL) and PIVKA-II (208 mAU/mL; normal range; < 40 mAU/mL) were both significantly elevated. Considering that the patient was still 20 weeks pregnant, delivery was not viable. However, surgery could not be delayed any longer given the rapid tumor growth, which could likely be associated with pregnancy. After discussion with at a cancer board consisting of experts from the departments of gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery, as well as obtaining appropriate informed consent from the patient and her family, we decided to perform hepatic resection after abortion. Subsequently, abortion surgery was performed at 21 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy, followed by subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 under general and epidural anesthesia 6 days later. Mental care for the patient was provided by obstetricians, surgeons, and nurses before and after abortion. After mobilizing the right lobe of the liver, we identified the Glissonian pedicle (G) 7 and injected indigo carmine under US guidance to mark the perfusion area. Thereafter, hepatic resection was initiated using an ultrasonic dissector under the Pringle’s maneuver. After identifying the G7, a clamp test was performed to reconfirming the ischemic area before ligating and cutting it. We continued hepatic resection along the RHV, exfoliated a tumor within the vicinity of a root of the RHV, and subsequently completed subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 (Fig. ). The surgery lasted 274 min, with an estimated blood loss of 940 mL. Macroscopically, the whitish tumor with a maximum diameter of 4.0 cm was simple nodular type and showed expansive growth (Fig. ). A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC, grade II, eg, fc (−), sf (+), s0, vp0, vv0, b0, im0, and sm (−) was thereafter established. Tumor cells showed a moderate degree of atypia, as well as a cord-like or pseudoglandular arrangement associated with abundant eosinophilic vesicles and a rich nucleoplasm. Given the good postoperative course, without particular complications, the patient was discharged 10 days after surgery. Approximately 2 years after surgery, the patient remains alive without recurrence, while both AFP and PIVKA-II were within normal limits.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
