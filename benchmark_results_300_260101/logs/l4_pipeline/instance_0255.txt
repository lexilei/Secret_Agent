Patient Note:
A 68-year-old woman arrived to the surgical pre-admission clinic this afternoon for evaluation ahead of next week’s elective laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy planned for recurrent, imaging-proven Hinchey I diverticulitis that has failed multiple courses of outpatient antibiotics over the past two years. She ambulated into the room without assistance, stating that over the last month she continues to work part-time as a substitute teacher, walks her dog one mile daily, and climbs a single flight of stairs to her bedroom without shortness of breath, chest pain, or lower-extremity swelling. She specifically denies any prior episodes of exertional angina, coronary stent placement, or cardiothoracic surgery, and reports no hospitalizations for fluid overload, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Her vascular history is notable for a left hemispheric transient ischemic attack three years ago manifested by transient right arm weakness and expressive aphasia that resolved within twenty minutes; she was subsequently started on low-dose aspirin and high-intensity rosuvastatin by neurology, has remained symptom-free since, and follows up annually for carotid duplex surveillance, the most recent study six months ago showing mild (20%) bilateral internal carotid plaque without hemodynamic significance. Past medical problems include well-controlled primary hypertension diagnosed at age 55, diet-managed type 2 diabetes mellitus first identified on routine screening five years ago with most recent hemoglobin A1c 6.3% on dietary modification alone and no history of oral or injectable glucose-lowering medications, stage 1 chronic kidney disease with stable baseline renal function, hypothyroidism on levothyroxine, and remote appendectomy in her twenties. She quit cigarette smoking three decades ago after a 10 pack-year exposure and currently has an occasional glass of wine on weekends; she denies recreational drug use. Family history is pertinent only for a father who died of stroke at 78 and a mother who is alive at 90 with osteoporosis; there is no familial coronary artery disease before age 60. Current medications include aspirin 81 mg daily, rosuvastatin 20 mg nightly, lisinopril 20 mg each morning, levothyroxine 75 µg daily, and a daily multivitamin; she has no medication allergies. Review of systems today is negative for palpitations, syncope, claudication, intermittent chest pressure, dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema, or weight gain. On examination, she appears comfortable, conversant, and oriented. Vital signs: blood pressure 132/68 mm Hg bilaterally, heart rate 66 beats/min in regular rhythm, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, temperature 36.7 °C orally, and oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. Body mass index is 29 kg/m². Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, gallops, or extra sounds; jugular venous pulsation is not elevated, and peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation with good air movement and no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft with mild left lower quadrant tenderness but no rebound, guarding, or masses. There is no pedal edema, and capillary refill is brisk. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves, normal strength and sensation in all extremities, and steady gait. Pre-operative laboratory testing drawn one hour prior demonstrates hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, hematocrit 38.5%, white blood cell count 5.8 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 235 × 10⁹/L, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 25 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 78 mL/min/1.73 m². Fasting glucose this morning was 104 mg/dL. Liver panel is unremarkable. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is 2.1 µIU/mL. Urinalysis is negative for protein or glucose. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats/min, normal axis, no Q waves, and no ST-segment deviations. A resting transthoracic echocardiogram performed last year for hypertension workup documented a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, normal wall motion, and mild concentric hypertrophy; lung ultrasound today shows no B-lines. Chest radiograph demonstrates clear lung fields and normal cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary function tests were deemed unnecessary given excellent exercise tolerance. Airway evaluation reveals a Mallampati class II oropharynx, full cervical extension, and an inter-incisor distance of 4 cm. She has been counseled on peri-operative medication management: aspirin is to be held five days prior to minimize bleeding risk, while rosuvastatin and lisinopril will be continued up to the morning of surgery; no glucose-lowering agents require adjustment. The patient verbalizes understanding of fasting instructions, wound expectations, and possible complications including bleeding, infection, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary compromise, and neurologic or cardiac events. She consents to proceed, and no additional cardiac testing is indicated based on stable functional capacity and lack of ischemic symptoms.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
