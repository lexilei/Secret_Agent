Patient Note:
A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history limited to diet-controlled type 2 diabetes and well-controlled hypertension walked into the emergency department this afternoon complaining that her entire right lower limb had progressively enlarged over the last thirty-six hours. She first noticed the change yesterday morning when her ankle strap sandals felt unusually tight and she had difficulty sliding her pant leg past the mid-thigh; by evening she required help from her partner to remove the shoe, and when she rose from bed today the leg felt heavy enough that climbing the three steps to her porch was laborious. She denies antecedent trauma, insect bite, recent soft-tissue infection, skiing or hiking incidents, vigorous exercise, or musculoskeletal strain. She has not had fever, chills, sweats, skin warmth, or erythema, and she specifically denies low-grade back pain, flank discomfort, or groin masses. There is no shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, palpitations, dizziness, abdominal pain, or urinary complaints. She works full-time as a bookstore manager, is on her feet most of the day, and commutes by city bus; she has not been confined to bed or a chair, nor has she taken any car or air trips longer than one hour during the past month. The patient has never undergone orthopedic casting, lower-extremity splinting, venous ablation, or vascular bypass, and her last surgical procedure was an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy eight years earlier. She recalls no personal or family history of clots in the legs or lungs and takes lisinopril 10 mg daily, metformin 500 mg twice daily, and a daily multivitamin; she does not use estrogen-containing medication, corticosteroids, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or antiplatelet drugs. She quit cigarette smoking twenty years ago after a 5-pack-year exposure, drinks two glasses of wine on weekends, and denies illicit drug use. On arrival she was alert, in no acute distress but visibly concerned. Vital signs before any pharmacologic therapy were temperature 36.9 °C, blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, heart rate 88 beats/minute and regular, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % breathing ambient air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed clear lung fields bilaterally and a regular S1/S2 without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdomen was soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no palpable masses. Inspection of the lower extremities showed striking asymmetry: the right limb appeared globally swollen from groin to ankle with a subtle glossy sheen of the skin, whereas the left limb maintained its usual contour. A tape measure placed 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity recorded a circumference of 41 cm on the right versus 37 cm on the left, a 4 cm discrepancy; at mid-femur the right measured 56 cm and the left 49 cm, confirming swelling that encompasses the entire length of the limb rather than being isolated to one segment. Over the anterior tibia of the right leg, firm thumb pressure produced a 3 mm depression that refilled in approximately 25 seconds; no indentation was produced on the contralateral side. The skin temperature of both calves and feet was equivalent by touch, and coloration remained pink without warmth, erythema, or streaking. No raised, tortuous, or engorged superficial venous channels were visible along the thigh, popliteal region, or calf, and gentle palpation in those regions did not reveal a palpable cord or focal tenderness. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally, capillary refill was less than two seconds, and sensation to light touch as well as motor strength graded 5/5 throughout. The knee, ankle, and hip joints moved through full active and passive ranges without crepitus or discomfort. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy, no femoral or popliteal bruit, and no signs of lymphedema such as peau d’orange or thickened dorsal foot skin. Laboratory studies drawn prior to any anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy revealed hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL, platelet count 243 × 10⁹/L, leukocytes 7.1 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, creatinine 0.88 mg/dL, AST 21 U/L, ALT 18 U/L, INR 1.0, and aPTT 29 seconds; a urine β-hCG was negative. Plain radiographs of the femur and tibia ordered by the triage physician were normal, showing no fracture or periosteal reaction. Given the acute, unilateral, full-length swelling with a measured calf circumference difference exceeding 3 cm, the presence of pitting confined to the symptomatic limb, absence of engorged superficial collaterals, preservation of arterial perfusion, and lack of recent immobilization, surgery, or an obvious infectious or musculoskeletal explanation, an obstructive process within the deep venous system of the right lower extremity is of primary concern, and emergent duplex ultrasonography of the iliac, femoral, popliteal, and calf veins has been requested to clarify the diagnosis before initiating definitive therapy.

Question: What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
