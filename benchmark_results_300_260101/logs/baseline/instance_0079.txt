He doesn't smoke o use any illicit drugs. He was febrile (38 c) with heart rate of 115 b/min, respiratory rate of 22, BP of 125/75 mmHg and O2 sat of 97%. Chest X-ray showed infiltrate in the middle of left lung with diameter of 1.8 cm with signs of cavitation. The sputum smear revealed positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are sensitive of the first-line TB drugs (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin and ethambutol). Lab study is reported bellow:
Hgb: 13 g/dl
WBC: 14000 /mm3
Plt: 300000 /ml
AST: 13 U/L
ALT: 15 U/L
Alk P: 53 U/L
Bill total: 0.6 mg/dl
Na: 137 mEq/l
K: 4 mEq/l
Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dl
BUN: 10 mg/dl
ESR: 120 mm/hr

Question: What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
