Patient Note:
A 77-year-old woman presenting with a one month history of progredient dyspnea underwent an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, which incidentally revealed a largely hyperdense upper pole lesion in the left kidney with a maximum diameter of 5.3 cm (). Parts of the lesion attained the renal pelvis. This finding was confirmed by ultrasound. An ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed RCC of the clear cell type (T1b N0 M0) (). She also suffered from primary hypertension (BP [blood pressure] 140-150/100 mmHg), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dilated cardiomyopathy and implantation of a cardiac pacemaker, mitral insufficiency (NYHA [New York Heart Association] III), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose value: 100-110 mg/dl), chronic renal failure (creatinine level: 1.5 mg/dl), and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Due to the markedly elevated perioperative risk (ASA [American Society of Anesthesiology] IV) the patient refused surgery.
Subsequently, the patient was referred for interventional treatment of the tumor. A percutaneous RF ablation was considered to be the most suitable therapeutic option. Due to the size of the lesion, the patient was scheduled for pre-interventional embolization of the central part of her tumor in order to achieve central necrosis and a more homogeneous heat distribution in the devascularized parts of the tumor. Iodinated oil (Lipiodol Ultra-Fluid®, Guerbet, Roissy, France) was considered for lesion tagging since it provides post-embolization contrast and allows for CT-guided placement of the RF-probe without use of additional contrast agent.
Embolization was performed via the right femoral approach using a 4 Fr introducer sheath. After selective catheterization of the left renal artery using a 4 Fr sidewinder catheter (Merit Medical, South Jordan, UT), a 3 Fr microcatheter (Progreat, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was placed in the tumor feeding vessels in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor was subsequently embolized using 10 ml of iodinated oil (Lipiodol, Guerbet, Roissy, France) (). Considering the patient's delicate renal condition, the use of iodinated contrast agent was limited to 10 ml (Visipaque 320, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ).
Prior to the RF ablation, a single-J catheter was placed in the left ureter with its tip in the collecting system, to accomplish external renal pelvis cooling. Preliminary testing of the single-J catheter only allowed for a drop-by-drop injection, which was insufficient for cooling and protection from thermal damage. Since the patient rejected conscious sedation, the procedure was performed under general anesthesia. Accordingly, the patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position; and, following an unenhanced CT (SOMATOM Sensation 16, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany; 16 × 0.75 mm, 120 kV, 165 mAseff), a CT-guided nephrostomy was performed using the trocar technique with a 6.5 Fr drainage (Resolve, Merit Medical, South Jordan, UT) to achieve sufficient cooling via the anterograde approach. Continuous cooling of the upper calices was performed with pre-chilled (8℃) 0.9% saline infused at a flow rate of 500 ml/h.
For RF ablation, four grounding pads were placed on the patient's proximal thighs. The procedure was carried out using a monopolar RF system (RF 3000, Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) in combination with a 5 cm umbrella-shaped LeVeen probe (Boston Scientific). Prior to the RF probe placement, the distal 1 cm of the probe insulation was removed to allow for post-interventional coagulation of the puncture tract. The electrode was placed under CT-guidance in the centre of the lesion (). After the final probe position was confirmed, energy was applied according to the manufacturer's recommendations for soft tissue ablation. Ablation was performed using the pullback technique at two positions, and achieving two complete roll-offs at each position. The total time of ablation was 74 minutes. Arterial and venous phase CT scan (SOMATOM Sensation 16, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany; 16×0.75 mm, 120 kV, 165 mAseff) with a reduced amount of contrast agent (80 ml Iodixanol, Visipaque, GE Healthcare) showed a completely devascularized tumor, with no sign of any residual contrast enhancement. Thereafter, the RF probe was gradually retracted under continuous coagulation of the puncture tract by applying 20 W.
No early or delayed complications were noted; however, due to her general condition, the patient was temporarily admitted to the intermediate care unit for observation. She recovered well and the single-J splint was removed a day after and the nephrostomy five days after the ablation. The patient was discharged the following day in good condition. A CT performed at eight months after the procedure, showed residual Lipiodol in the area of the ablation without signs of local renal tumor recurrence ().

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
