Patient Note:
In November 2007, a 49-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital from an orthopaedist complaining of a one year history of sustained difficulty walking and severe bilateral hip pain. Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3− 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10–50 pg/ml) level.
Urinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.
The calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3− 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient’s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).
The patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient’s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.
The patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 μg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day). One year after the treatment, the patient became asymptomatic and renal function remained stable. Furthermore, MRI showed the bilateral transcervical fractures of the femoral neck had almost fully repaired (Fig. ). Treatment is currently being continued in the outpatient clinic.

Question: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, we follow these steps:

### 1. **Determine the patient's adjusted body weight:**
   - **Height:** 155.5 cm  
   - **Actual weight:** 61.0 kg  
   - **BMI Calculation:**  
     \[
     \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2} = \frac{61.0}{(1.555)^2} = 25.2 \, \text{kg/m}^2
     \]
   - Since BMI ≥ 25 (overweight), we use **adjusted body weight** (ABW):  
     \[
     \text{Ideal Body Weight (IBW)} = 45.5 + 2.3 \times (\text{Height in inches} - 60)  
     \]
     Convert height to inches:  
     \[
     155.5 \, \text{cm} = 61.22 \, \text{in}  
     \]
     \[
     \text{IBW} = 45.5 + 2.3 \times (61.22 - 60) = 45.5 + 2.3 \times 1.22 = 48.3 \, \text{kg}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Body Weight} = \text{IBW} + 0.4 \times (\text{Actual Weight} - \text{IBW})  
     \]
     \[
     \text{ABW} = 48.3 + 0.4 \times (61.0 - 48.3) = 48.3 + 5.08 = 53.38 \, \text{kg}
     \]

### 2. **Apply the Cockcroft-Gault equation (for women):**
   \[
   \text{CrCl} = \frac{(140 - \text{Age}) \times \text{Adjusted Body Weight (kg)} \times 0.85}{72 \times \text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)}}
   \]
   - **Age:** 49  
   - **Serum Creatinine:** 1.4 mg/dL  
   - **ABW:** 53.38 kg  
   \[
   \text{CrCl} = \frac{(140 - 49) \times 53.38 \times 0.85}{72 \times 1.4} = \frac{91 \times 45.373}{100.8} = \frac{4128.943}{100.8} = 40.96 \, \text{mL/min}
   \]

### Final Answer:
40.96
