Patient Note:
The patient was a 97 years old Hispanic male who was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and increasing fatigue. Two weeks prior to the current symptoms, the patient had been admitted, diagnosed with pneumonia, treated with antibiotics and then discharged home. Pertinent past medical history included hypertension, chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, anemia, recurrent clostridium difficile colitis, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, cerebrovascular accident without deficit, hyperlipidemia, cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and colon polyps. Of note, the patient had been hospitalized 9 times in the past 12 months. Past surgical history included an appendectomy, repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and colonoscopy 2 years prior with unknown results. He had an allergy to penicillin. Family history was noncontributory. Current medications included moxifloxacin day 5, metroniadazole, amlodipine, omeprazole and losartan. Review of systems revealed weight loss, abdominal pain, and back, hip and leg pain.
Vital signs on admission were unremarkable. Remarkable examination findings included cachexia, scleral icterus, white coating on tongue, bibasilar rhonchi, rales and wheezes, diffuse bilateral lower quadrant pain, guiaic positive stool, and tenderness in the lumbar and gluteal regions. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Initial laboratory data revealed white blood cell count 12,200, hemoglobin 7.1, hematocrit 22.7, and platelets 291,000. Chemistry profile revealed BUN (blood urea nitrogen) 24, creatinine 1.34, glucose 134, and calcium 10.9. The remainder was unremarkable.
Chest radiograph on admission noted mild bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with bibasilar air disease not significantly changed from the week prior.
The patient was admitted with the following diagnoses: acute on chronic anemia secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, and oral candidiasis.
Over the next several days, as his multiple medical problems were addressed, the team noted a persistent left pleural effusion. A pulmonology consult was requested and thoracentesis performed. Pleural fluid analysis returned with features consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. FISH analysis was positive for a clonal BCL-1/IgH gene rearrangement. Flow cytometry revealed Kappa monoclonal B-lymphocytes co-expressing CD5 and CD19 with no CD23 expression. Cyclin D1 translocation was positive as well. At this point, hematology and palliative care consults were requested.
Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed mediastinal adenopathy, diffuse gastric, pyloric and proximal duodenal wall thickening, as well as possible metastatic lesions in the pelvis with multiple ill-defined lucencies. Final diagnosis was metastatic Stage IV (Ann Arbor) Mantle cell lymphoma. With our patient’s advanced age, debilitated state and multiple medical problems, all members of the medical care team agreed with a hospice referral. The care team presented the recommendation to the patient’s caregiver.
The primary care and the palliative care team met with the patient’s daughter several times during the hospitalization to discuss her father’s diagnosis and prognosis. The team struggled to elucidate the role of hospice for her and, through her, for the family members not present. Family dynamics played a major role in the primary caregiver’s ambivalence toward hospice. Hospice was presented as a way for her father to stay at home and continue to be comfortable. She would have to help as necessary. The patient was discharged home to the care of his daughter and hospice. He is currently still alive and receiving regular physician home visits. He has not been told about the nature of his diagnosis. When the patient was asked by his PCP if he wanted to know the diagnosis, he continued to refer to his oldest daughter.

Question: Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? If the patient is black, please use the MDRD GFR Equation for Blacks. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
