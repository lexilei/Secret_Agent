Patient Note:
A 58-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 90 minutes of central chest pressure that began while carrying groceries from her car. She described the discomfort as a heavy, squeezing sensation located retrosternally, radiating to the left arm and lower jaw, accompanied by diaphoresis, mild shortness of breath, and nausea without emesis. She noted two briefer episodes over the past week with brisk walking, each resolving after several minutes of rest, but today’s pain persisted despite stopping activity and sitting. She denied pleuritic features, cough, fever, rhinorrhea, trauma, or recent upper respiratory symptoms. She reported no similar pain from reflux and had not noticed burning or sour taste; antacids at home did not change her symptoms. She denied chest wall tenderness or positional component to the pain. There was no antecedent prolonged immobility, calf swelling, hemoptysis, or known hypercoagulable condition. She has a history of coronary artery disease with a drug-eluting stent placed four years ago after a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; she follows with cardiology and reports taking a daily antiplatelet agent. She does not use tobacco or nicotine products and reports no exposure to secondhand smoke at home. She has never been on insulin or any oral glucose-lowering medications and states prior routine labs have consistently shown normal fasting glucose; triage comprehensive metabolic panel drawn prior to any treatment today shows glucose 96 mg/dL with normal electrolytes and creatinine. She reports no prior episodes of sudden focal neurologic deficits such as unilateral weakness, facial droop, speech arrest, or transient monocular vision loss. Weight at triage is 92 kg with a height of 165 cm (BMI approximately 33.8 kg/m²). She denies ever being told her lipids were elevated, is not taking any lipid-lowering medication, and reports a recent outpatient lipid panel within goal range; she was not started on additional therapy at that time. She drinks alcohol rarely, denies recreational drug use, and works in an office setting. There is no recent surgery, immobilization, or known malignancy. On arrival she appeared mildly uncomfortable and diaphoretic but not in acute respiratory distress. Vital signs prior to any interventions: temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 94 bpm regular, blood pressure 138/86 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Physical examination showed clear lungs to auscultation bilaterally without rales or wheeze, normal work of breathing, and no chest wall tenderness to palpation. Cardiac exam revealed a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no audible murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no jugular venous distension. Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetric without edema. Abdomen was soft and non-tender without epigastric tenderness. Neurologic exam was nonfocal with intact cranial nerves and normal motor strength. At triage, an electrocardiogram obtained prior to medication showed significant repolarization abnormalities characterized by horizontal ST depressions measuring 2 to 3 mm in leads V4–V6 with associated T-wave inversions in the lateral leads and 1–2 mm ST depression in the inferior leads; QRS duration and intervals were within normal limits, there were no ST elevations, and no pathologic Q waves were noted. No prior ECG was immediately available for comparison. Initial laboratory testing drawn on arrival showed a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level of 176 ng/L (reference ≤18 ng/L), obtained before any analgesics or antiplatelet agents were administered in the emergency department. Complete blood count was unremarkable with no leukocytosis or anemia. Renal function and electrolytes were within normal limits as above. A portable chest radiograph performed at the bedside demonstrated a normal cardiac silhouette without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The nature of the pain (exertional onset evolving to pain at rest, pressure quality, radiation to arm and jaw, associated diaphoresis and nausea, and lack of reproducibility with palpation or positional changes), the known history of coronary stent placement for prior myocardial ischemia, and the ECG pattern with lateral ST segment depressions were concerning for an acute coronary syndrome. She remained hemodynamically stable without hypotension throughout the initial evaluation, was alert and oriented, and did not display features of an alternative urgent noncardiac condition necessitating admission independent of the chest pain evaluation. She had not taken any medications prior to arrival for this episode and no treatments had been administered at the time these findings were documented.

Question: What is the patient's score of the HEART Score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
