THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with multiple PCIs and presents with chest pain consistent with prior angina. This is highly suspicious for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which would score 2 points.\n2. **ECG**: The ECG shows sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block and lateral T-wave inversions, which are nonspecific but could indicate ischemia. This would score 1 point.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 64 years old, which is less than 65, so this scores 0 points.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, which are 3 risk factors. This would score 2 points (since ≥3 risk factors = 2 points).\n5. **Troponin**: The troponin T level is 0.02 ng/mL, which is within the normal range (0–0.03 ng/mL). This scores 0 points.\n\nNow, let's sum the points: History (2) + ECG (1) + Age (0) + Risk factors (2) + Troponin (0) = 5 points.\n\nThe HEART Score is 5.</thought>\n<answer>5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:24:16.117826'}
