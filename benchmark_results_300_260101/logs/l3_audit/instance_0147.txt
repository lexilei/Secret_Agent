However, the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate was successfully used, yielding a result of 39.632 mL/min/1.73 m². Since the task specifically asks for the MDRD GFR Equation, I need to ensure that the correct calculator is used. However, the available calculators list does not include the MDRD GFR Equation explicitly. Given this, the closest alternative is the CKD-EPI Equations, which is a more modern and accurate method for estimating GFR.
