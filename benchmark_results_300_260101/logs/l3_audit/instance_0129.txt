THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission. However, the Wells' criteria is not listed among the available calculators. The available calculators are for Creatinine Clearance, CKD-EPI Equations, CHA2DS2-VASc Score, BMI, and Ideal Body Weight. Since the task specifically asks for the Wells' criteria score, and it's not available, I cannot compute it with the given tools. Therefore, I need to conclude that the task cannot be completed with the provided tools.</thought>\n<answer>N/A</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:27:04.136394'}

TOTAL VIOLATIONS: 3
FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
