{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to assess the patient\'s risk factors based on the following criteria:\n1. High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease (including MI or current angina)\n3. History of congestive heart failure\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA)\n5. Preoperative treatment with insulin\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The surgery is an elective right inguinal herniorrhaphy, which is not considered high-risk (1 point if yes, 0 if no).\n- The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction eight years ago (1 point).\n- No history of congestive heart failure (0 points).\n- No history of cerebrovascular disease (0 points).\n- The patient is on metformin, not insulin, for diabetes (0 points).\n- Preoperative serum creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL (1 point).\n\nNow, we need to extract the relevant values to confirm these points.</thought>\n<action>extract_clinical_values(patient_note="A 62-year-old man was referred by his general surgeon for pre-operative assessment three weeks before a planned elective right inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia. He reports that the bulge has been enlarging over the past year and is now intermittently painful, particularly when lifting boxes at his job in a warehouse, but it has never incarcerated. The operation is anticipated to be completed through an open anterior approach with an expected surgical time of less than two hours and minimal blood loss. He arrives to clinic walking unassisted from the parking lot and states he can easily climb a flight of stairs and mow his lawn with a push mower without stopping, although he slows his pace when the weather is hot. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower-extremity swelling, or exercise-induced dyspnea beyond what he attributes to deconditioning. His weight is stable. He has a remote cardiovascular history notable for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction eight years ago that required percutaneous coronary intervention with placement of a single drug-eluting stent in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Since that event he has not experienced further chest discomfort, emergency visits, or revascularization, and he follows regularly with cardiology. He takes aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel was discontinued more than a year ago, and he remains on high-intensity atorvastatin. His other chronic medications include lisinopril 10 mg daily for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily, and metformin 500 mg twice daily to keep his fasting glucose in the 110–120 mg/dL range. He explicitly states he has never required injections to control his blood sugar and has not experienced hypoglycemia. There is no personal history of heart failure, valvular surgery, arrhythmia requiring therapy, peripheral vascular intervention, or carotid disease. He underwent colonoscopy screening at age 60 without complication and has no previous general anesthesia issues. Family history is positive for premature coronary artery disease in two older brothers; no familial sudden death or bleeding diathesis is reported. He quit cigarette smoking fifteen years ago after a 20-pack-year history and drinks one beer on weekends. Review of systems is negative for syncope, palpitations, transient neurological deficits, hematuria, gross edema, abdominal pain, or fevers. On examination his blood pressure is 132/78 mm Hg, heart rate 62 beats/min regular, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 97 % on room air, and temperature 36.7 °C. He is a well-appearing male in no distress. Jugular venous pulsation is not elevated. The point of maximal impulse is not displaced; S1 and S2 are normal without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung fields are clear bilaterally with no rales or wheezes. Abdomen is soft with a reducible right inguinal defect; no ascites. Extremities show no pitting edema; peripheral pulses are palpable and symmetric. Neurologic examination reveals normal strength and sensation. Laboratory testing obtained this morning demonstrates hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL, platelet count 225 × 10³/µL, sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, bicarbonate 25 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 35 mg/dL, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, a stable finding compared with his outpatient panel two months ago. Estimated glomerular filtration rate is 38 mL/min/1.73 m². Electrolytes otherwise unremarkable, hepatic panel normal, and coagulation indices within reference ranges. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, Q-waves in inferior leads consistent with old infarct, and no acute ST-T changes. A recent transthoracic echocardiogram from six months prior revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 %, normal wall motion, and no significant valvular lesion. Chest radiograph today demonstrates clear lung fields and normal cardiac silhouette. The patient expresses understanding of surgical risks, including potential cardiac complications, and is eager to proceed so he can return to work.
