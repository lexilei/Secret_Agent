THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, I need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following components: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. The HEART Score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher risk. Here's how I will break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a concerning history of chest pain (pressure-like, radiating to the back, 7/10 severity, lasting several minutes). This is highly suspicious and would score 2 points.\n2. **EKG**: The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes, which scores 0 points.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 37 years old, which is less than 45, so this scores 0 points.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient is morbidly obese, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. This would score 1 point.\n5. **Troponin**: The patient's troponin was elevated (440>606>872 ng/mL), which is significantly above the normal range (0-0.4 ng/mL). This would score 2 points.\n\nAdding these up: 2 (History) + 0 (EKG) + 0 (Age) + 1 (Risk factors) + 2 (Troponin) = 5 points total.</thought>\n<answer>5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:21:31.505815'}
