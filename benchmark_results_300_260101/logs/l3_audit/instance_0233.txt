THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the Wells' criteria scoring system. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nThe Wells' criteria for DVT includes the following components:\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - 1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - 1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - 1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - 1 point\n5. Entire leg swelling - 1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) - 1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - 1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - 1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT - minus 2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information:\n- The patient has no history of thromboembolic disease, limb casting, or recent hospitalization - so no points for criteria 2 or 3.\n- The patient has diffuse swelling of the entire limb - 1 point for criterion 5.\n- The calf swelling difference is 4.5 cm (>3 cm) - 1 point for criterion 6.\n- The patient has no localized tenderness along the deep venous system - no point for criterion 4.\n- The patient has no pitting edema or collateral superficial veins mentioned - no points for criteria 7 or 8.\n- The patient has an alternative diagnosis (cellulitis or post-contusional hematoma) that is plausible - minus 2 points for criterion 9.\n- No mention of active cancer - no point for criterion 1.\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (entire leg swelling) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) - 2 (alternative diagnosis) = 0 points total.\n\nThus, the Wells' criteria score for DVT is 0.</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:09:30.017746'}
