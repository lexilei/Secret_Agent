THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To determine the patient\'s Wells\' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient\'s medical values and health status based on the Wells\' criteria components. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. Here\'s how the patient\'s case aligns with the criteria:\n\n1. **Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative)**: The patient has no history of malignant disease. **Score: 0**\n2. **Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities**: The patient has no paralysis, paresis, or immobilization. **Score: 0**\n3. **Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks requiring general or regional anesthesia**: The patient had a cesarean section 6 weeks ago (within 12 weeks) with spinal anesthesia. **Score: 1**\n4. **Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system**: The patient has focal tenderness along the popliteal vein and posteromedial calf. **Score: 1**\n5. **Entire leg swollen**: The swelling is confined to the left calf, not the entire leg. **Score: 0**\n6. **Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity)**: The patient\'s calf swelling is 1.6 cm (38.0 cm vs. 36.4 cm), which is less than 3 cm. **Score: 0**\n7. **Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg**: The patient has pitting edema confined to the left calf. **Score: 1**\n8. **Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose)**: No mention of collateral superficial veins. **Score: 0**\n9. **Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT**: The note states that DVT is the leading consideration, so no alternative diagnosis is more likely. **Score: 0**\n\nAdding up the scores: 0 (cancer) + 0 (paralysis) + 1 (surgery) + 1 (tenderness) + 0 (entire leg) + 0 (calf swelling) + 1 (pitting edema) + 0 (collateral veins) + 0 (alternative diagnosis) = **Total Score: 3**\n\nThe Wells\' criteria score for this patient is 3, which places them in the "moderate probability" category for DVT.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:10:26.562515'}
