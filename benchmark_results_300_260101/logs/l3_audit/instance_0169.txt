THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>The patient's Ideal Body Weight (IBW) has already been calculated using the correct formula and extracted values (sex: male, height_cm: 185). The result from the computation is 79.52 kg, which matches the task's requirement to use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
