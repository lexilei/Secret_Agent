His blood pressure was 86/48 mmHg and heart rate was 70 bpm (normal sinus rhythm). His laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelet count, 132 × 109/L; total protein, 5.7 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; triglycerides, 54 mg/dL; LDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; HDL-cholesterol, 44 mg/dL; Ca, 8.1 mg/dL; P, 3.1 mg/dL; HbA1c, 7.0%; and BNP, 3461 pg/mL.
