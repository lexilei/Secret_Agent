THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin. However, the patient note does not provide information about Troponin levels, which is a critical component of the HEART Score. Since the task specifies to use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment, and Troponin is not mentioned, we cannot accurately calculate the HEART Score. Therefore, we cannot proceed with the calculation.</thought>\n<answer>Insufficient data to calculate HEART Score</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:24:02.747773'}

FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step

  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
