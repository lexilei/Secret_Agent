{'content': "<thought>The task requires calculating the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the MDRD GFR Equation, but the available calculators do not include this specific equation. The CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate is available, but it also failed to compute, possibly due to the patient's age (17) being outside the typical range for which the CKD-EPI equation is validated (usually for adults). Since the MDRD GFR Equation is not available and the CKD-EPI equation is not suitable for this patient, I cannot proceed with the calculation using the provided tools. Therefore, I will provide the final answer based on the extracted values and the MDRD GFR Equation formula for females (non-Black): GFR = 186 * (SCr)^-1.154 * (age)^-0.203 * (0.742 if female).</thought>\n<answer>8.47</answer>", 'step_number': 7, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:38:09.211443'}
