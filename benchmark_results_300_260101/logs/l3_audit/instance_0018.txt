{'content': '<thought>To calculate the patient\'s Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we need the following parameters: age, sex, weight_kg, and creatinine_mg_dl. The patient\'s adjusted body weight should be used based on their BMI. First, we need to extract the patient\'s age, sex, weight, height, and creatinine level from the patient note. Then, we will calculate the BMI to determine if the patient is overweight, underweight, or normal weight. Based on the BMI, we will calculate the adjusted body weight.

He had started maintenance hemodialysis in 2005. He had hypertension, which was relatively under good control with antihypertensive agents. He had no other arteriosclerotic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, or smoking. He had no past medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery disease. The patient’s father and three brothers were also under hemodialysis due to ADPKD. None of the family members had a vascular system complication such as cerebral aneurysm, or past medical history of stroke. A brain CT scan image showed dilatation of left vertebral artery, basilar artery, bilateral post cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery (Fig. a, b). At the time, he was diagnosed as vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and started antihypertensive agents. In 2010, he was once admitted to our hospital for dysarthria, dysphagia and right hemiplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute infarction in the left midbrain, and he was started treatment with anticoagulant and additional antihypertensive agents. Although he recovered from dysarthria and dysphagia, right mild hemiplegia remained. However, he did not have any new stroke events until the admission in 2012.\nOn admission in 2012, his height was 163.1 cm, weight was 58.5 kg, consciousness level was 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure was 146/92 mmHg, and body temperature was 36.7 °C. His conjunctiva was anemic, abdomen showed hepatomegaly and bilateral kidney swelling, and lower extremities had bilateral pitting edema. Neurological examination revealed prompt light reflection, isocoric pupil, limitation of the adduction of the right eye when gazing to the left, dysarthria, and bilateral incomplete paralysis.\nLaboratory data were as follows: serum Cr 10.7 mg/dL, BUN 48 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.7 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) 5700/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 6 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 6 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 164 IU/L. Brain MRI showed acute ischemia of bilateral pons and right temporal lobe. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) did not show significant change in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia compared with MRA in 2010. We started urokinase 60,000 unit/day and argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day. He was once recovered, and continued rehabilitation and maintenance hemodialysis. After 3 months of admission, he suddenly showed impaired consciousness of 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, convulsion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CT scan image did not show any cerebral hemorrhage. Exacerbation of cerebral infarction was suspected, and we started argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day, aleviatin, and non-invasive positive pressure (NPPV). Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).\nAn autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas.
