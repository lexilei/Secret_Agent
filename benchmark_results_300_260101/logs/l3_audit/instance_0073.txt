THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>The previous attempt to compute the mean arterial pressure (MAP) failed because the calculator name 'mean_arterial_pressure' is not listed in the available calculators. However, the formula for MAP is well-known: MAP = diastolic BP + (systolic BP - diastolic BP) / 3. Since we have the systolic BP (120 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (75 mm Hg), we can manually compute the MAP using this formula.</thought>\n<answer>90.00</answer>", 'step_number': 2, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:14:39.288253'}
