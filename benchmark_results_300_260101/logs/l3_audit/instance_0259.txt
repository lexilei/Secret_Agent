THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to identify the following risk factors from the patient's medical history prior to any treatment:\n\n1. High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease\n3. History of congestive heart failure\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease\n5. Preoperative treatment with insulin\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The surgery is a right total knee arthroplasty, which is not a high-risk surgery (1 point if yes).\n- The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% (1 point).\n- The patient has a history of a small left thalamic infarct (1 point for cerebrovascular disease).\n- The patient does not have diabetes mellitus and is not on insulin (0 points).\n- The patient's preoperative serum creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL, which is not >2.0 mg/dL (0 points).\n\nThus, the patient has 2 risk factors (history of heart failure and cerebrovascular disease). The RCRI score is the sum of these risk factors.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:19:40.903936'}

FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
