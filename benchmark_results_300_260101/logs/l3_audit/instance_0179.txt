THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the patient\'s Ideal Body Weight (IBW), I need to use the Ideal Body Weight formula. The formula requires the patient\'s sex and height in centimeters. From the patient note, the patient is a 50-year-old woman, so the sex is female. The height is given as 1.65 meters, which needs to be converted to centimeters (165 cm). The formula for females is: IBW = 45.5 + 2.3 * (height_in_inches - 60). First, I need to convert the height from centimeters to inches (1 cm = 0.393701 inches).</thought>\n\n<action>compute_calculation(calculator_name="Ideal Body Weight", values={"sex": "female", "height_cm": 165})</action>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:41:38.751173'}

THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>The patient's Ideal Body Weight (IBW) has already been calculated using the correct formula and extracted values (sex: female, height_cm: 165). The result from the calculation is 56.909 kg.
