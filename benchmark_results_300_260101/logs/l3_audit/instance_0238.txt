THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient's medical values and health status based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes the following points:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): Not mentioned in the note.\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: Not mentioned.\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: Not mentioned.\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: Not mentioned.\n5. Entire leg swollen: Yes, the right limb is globally swollen from groin to ankle.\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg: Yes, the right calf is 41 cm vs. 37 cm on the left (4 cm difference).\n7. Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg: Yes, pitting edema is present on the right leg only.\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): Not mentioned.\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT: No alternative diagnosis is mentioned as likely or more likely.\n\nFrom the note, the patient scores points for:\n- Entire leg swollen (+1)\n- Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (+1)\n- Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg (+1)\n\nTotal score: 3 points.\n\nThe Wells' criteria score is 3.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:13:00.804897'}

FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
