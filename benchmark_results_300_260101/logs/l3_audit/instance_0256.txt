THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to assess the following criteria based on the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission:\n\n1. High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures) - Nephroureterectomy qualifies as high-risk surgery.\n2. History of ischemic heart disease - Not mentioned in the note.\n3. History of congestive heart failure - Not mentioned in the note.\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease - Not mentioned in the note.\n5. Preoperative treatment with insulin - Not mentioned in the note.\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL - The patient's creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL, which is below the threshold.\n\nFrom the patient note, the only applicable criterion is the high-risk surgery (nephroureterectomy). The other criteria are not met. Therefore, the RCRI score is 1.</thought>\n<answer>1</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:19:11.892903'}

  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
