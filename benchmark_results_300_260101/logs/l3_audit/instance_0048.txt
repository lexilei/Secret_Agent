CRITIC VERDICT: repair_needed
CONFIDENCE: 0.475
TOTAL VIOLATIONS: 3
FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation

REPAIR ATTEMPTS: 1
REPAIR SUCCESS: False
REPAIR ACTIONS TAKEN:
  - RepairAction(action_type=<RepairActionType.REGENERATE_STEP: 'regenerate_step'>, step_index=0, details={'method': 'rewind_and_regenerate'}, reason='Trace must have at least one step; LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation; LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation')
