THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nThe Wells\' criteria components and their scores are:\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - +1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - +1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - +1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - +1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen - +1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) - +1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - +1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - +1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT - -2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information:\n- The patient has active cancer (stage IIIB invasive ductal carcinoma, completed neoadjuvant paclitaxel six weeks ago) - +1 point\n- The patient has persistent mild right-sided hemiparesis and uses a hinged ankle-foot orthosis - +1 point (for paresis)\n- The patient has localized tenderness in the right calf - +1 point\n- The right calf circumference is 36 cm vs 34.5 cm on the left (difference of 1.5 cm, which is less than 3 cm) - 0 points\n- There is a web-like network of bluish subcutaneous channels (collateral superficial veins) - +1 point\n- The patient\'s symptoms do not currently favor musculoskeletal strain or peripheral neuropathy, and there is no clinical suspicion for arterial insufficiency, so no alternative diagnosis is more likely - 0 points (not -2)\n\nNow, let\'s sum the points:\n1. Active cancer: +1\n2. Paresis: +1\n3. Localized tenderness: +1\n4. Collateral superficial veins: +1\nTotal: 4 points\n\nThe Wells\' criteria score is 4, which places the patient in the "moderate probability" category for DVT.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:03:20.913165'}
