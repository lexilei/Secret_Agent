THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score, I need to identify the relevant risk factors from the patient's medical history and current status at admission. The RCRI score is based on the following criteria:\n1. High-risk surgery (not applicable here as the patient is not undergoing surgery)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease (not mentioned in the note)\n3. History of congestive heart failure (not mentioned)\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease (not mentioned)\n5. Diabetes mellitus (not mentioned)\n6. Renal insufficiency (creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or CrCl <60 mL/min)\n\nFrom the patient note, the relevant factor is renal insufficiency, as the patient's creatinine was 19.9 mg/dL at admission, which is significantly higher than 2.0 mg/dL. No other RCRI criteria are met based on the provided information.</thought>\n<answer>1</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:16:11.119421'}

FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
