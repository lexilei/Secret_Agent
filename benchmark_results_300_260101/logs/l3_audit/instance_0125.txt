{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to extract specific clinical values from the patient note. The Wells\' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, recent surgery or immobilization, previous DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. However, the patient note does not explicitly mention all these factors. I will extract the relevant values that are mentioned, such as heart rate, presence of malignancy, and other clinical signs.</thought>\n<action>extract_clinical_values(patient_note="Our patient was a 48-year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who presented to the hospital with a two-week history of dry cough, fever, red conjunctiva, chills, malaise, myalgias, and generalized weakness. She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation. On physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 °C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable. Relevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271). The patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ). A CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics. The infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology. The patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli. Surgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma. A tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases. During the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 °C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up. Her fever and ocular symptoms resolved. She was seen in an outpatient clinic prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and then moved to a different location.", required_values=["heart_rate", "malignancy", "hemoptysis", "clinical_signs_of_dvt", "alternative_diagnosis_less_likely_than_pe"])</action>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:24:30.032540'}
