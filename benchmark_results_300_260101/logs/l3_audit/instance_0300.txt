The patient had a series of comorbidities: hepatic steatosis, chronic alcohol liver disease, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease, and essential hypertension. Objective examination showed an agitated, tachypneic patient, with congested facies, dry skin and mucosae, harsh vesicular murmur, right basal crepitant rales, with peripheral oxygen saturation 92%, blood pressure 200/160 mmHg, ventricular rate 106 bpm, afebrile at the time of examination. Chest X-ray evidenced a pulmonary condensation area in the posterior inferior third of the right lung (A,B). Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia (white blood cells 1110/μL, lymphocytes 190/μL), thrombocytopenia (127,000/μL), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (15.6 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.15, hepatocytolysis (aspartate aminotransferase 88.8 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 82.8 units/L), total bilirubin 2.88 mg/dL, reduced creatinine clearance (63.8 mL/min), nitrogen retention (creatinine 1.82 mg/dL), inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein 450 mg/L), antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 were not detectable, nonreactive anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Combined throat/nasal sampling (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania) was performed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS CoV-2 (QuantStudio v5 analysis method with TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit, The QuantStudioTM Design & Analysis Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis. The diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation. The necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified. Given the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene—inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol []. For the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen. The histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection. In the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen. On this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A). Eosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak (). In the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori’s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D). Giemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance (). In the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms. The myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B). The kidney presents diffuse tubular necrosis (shock kidney) (C), and in the adrenal glands, massive medullary hemorrhage can be observed (D).

For the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen. The histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection. In the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen. On this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A). Eosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak (). In the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori’s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D). Giemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance (). In the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms. The myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B). The kidney presents diffuse tubular necrosis (shock kidney) (C), and in the adrenal glands, massive medullary hemorrhage can be observed (D).

The patient had a series of comorbidities: hepatic steatosis, chronic alcohol liver disease, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease, and essential hypertension. Objective examination showed an agitated, tachypneic patient, with congested facies, dry skin and mucosae, harsh vesicular murmur, right basal crepitant rales, with peripheral oxygen saturation 92%, blood pressure 200/160 mmHg, ventricular rate 106 bpm, afebrile at the time of examination. Chest X-ray evidenced a pulmonary condensation area in the posterior inferior third of the right lung (A,B). Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia (white blood cells 1110/μL, lymphocytes 190/μL), thrombocytopenia (127,000/μL), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (15.6 s), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.15, hepatocytolysis (aspartate aminotransferase 88.8 units/L, alanine aminotransferase 82.8 units/L), total bilirubin 2.88 mg/dL, reduced creatinine clearance (63.8 mL/min), nitrogen retention (creatinine 1.82 mg/dL), inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein 450 mg/L), antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 were not detectable, nonreactive anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies. Combined throat/nasal sampling (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania) was performed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS CoV-2 (QuantStudio v5 analysis method with TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit, The QuantStudioTM Design & Analysis Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis. The diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation. The necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified. Given the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive.
