His past medical history was notable for hypertension that was well controlled on lisinopril. He was also prescribed with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate 2 years ago due to low testosterone.

He had normal heart sounds without any murmurs and rubs and had clear lungs. He had trace pedal edema bilaterally without any calf tenderness. Laboratory results include leukocytes of 15.4 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 15.8 g/dL, platelets of 207 × 109/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and troponin I <0.05 ng/ml initially, but later plateaued at 0.10 ng/ml.

Immobilization or surgery in the past 4 weeks (1.5 points)\n5. Previous DVT/PE (1.5 points)\n6. Hemoptysis (1 point)\n7. Malignancy (1 point)\n\nFrom the extracted values:\n- The patient has clinical signs of DVT (trace pedal edema bilaterally and acute DVT confirmed by Doppler) → 3 points\n- PE is the most likely diagnosis given the CTA findings → 3 points\n- Heart rate is 134 (>100) → 1.5 points\n- No history of DVT/PE → 0 points\n- No hemoptysis → 0 points\n- No malignancy → 0 points\n- No recent immobilization or surgery → 0 points\n\nNow, I will sum these points to get the Wells' criteria score.</thought>\n<answer>7.5</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:26:24.981813'}
