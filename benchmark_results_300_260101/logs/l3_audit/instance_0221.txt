THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the Wells' criteria scoring system. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. Here are the components of the Wells' criteria and the corresponding scores:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - 1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - 1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for more than 3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - 1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - 1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen - 1 point\n6. Calf swelling at least 3 cm larger than the asymptomatic side (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) - 1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - 1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose) - 1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT - subtract 2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information:\n- The patient has been bedridden for more than 3 days (1 point).\n- The left calf is swollen with a difference of 5 cm compared to the right (1 point).\n- There is no mention of active cancer, paralysis, recent surgery, localized tenderness along the deep venous system, entire leg swelling, pitting edema, or collateral superficial veins.\n- The patient has a prior history of DVT (not explicitly part of the Wells' criteria but relevant for clinical context).\n- There is no alternative diagnosis mentioned that is as likely or greater than DVT (no subtraction of points).\n\nThus, the total Wells' score is 2 points (1 for bedridden >3 days + 1 for calf swelling >3 cm difference).</thought>\n<answer>2.00</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:01:55.815820'}
