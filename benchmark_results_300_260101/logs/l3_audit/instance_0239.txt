THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient's medical values and health status based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes the following points:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - 1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - 1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - 1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - 1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen - 1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) - 1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - 1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - 1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT - subtract 2 points\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The patient had a hysterectomy 5 weeks ago (major surgery within 4 weeks? No, it's been 5 weeks, so 0 points).\n- The entire right leg is swollen (1 point).\n- Calf swelling is 38 cm on the right vs 36.5 cm on the left (difference is 1.5 cm, which is less than 3 cm, so 0 points).\n- Pitting edema is present on the right leg (1 point).\n- No localized tenderness along the deep venous system (0 points).\n- No paralysis or recent plaster immobilization (0 points).\n- No active cancer (0 points).\n- No collateral superficial veins (0 points).\n- No alternative diagnosis is mentioned as likely or greater than DVT (0 points, no subtraction).\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (entire leg swollen) + 1 (pitting edema) = 2 points.\n\nThe Wells' criteria score is 2.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:13:22.471898'}
