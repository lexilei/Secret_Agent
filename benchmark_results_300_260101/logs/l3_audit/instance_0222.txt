THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information for Wells\' criteria:\n1. Active cancer (within 6 months): No (0 points)\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: No (0 points)\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: The patient had surgery 6 weeks ago, which is outside the 4-week window (0 points)\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: No (0 points)\n5. Entire leg swollen: Yes (1 point)\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg: Yes (1 point) - The patient has a 4 cm difference\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg): No (0 points)\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): No (0 points)\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT: No (0 points) - The note states "absence of an alternative explanation"\n\nAdding up the points: 0 (cancer) + 0 (paralysis) + 0 (bedridden/surgery) + 0 (tenderness) + 1 (entire leg swollen) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) + 0 (pitting edema) + 0 (collateral veins) + 0 (alternative diagnosis) = 2 points.\n\nThe Wells\' criteria score for this patient is 2, which places them in the "moderate probability" category for DVT.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:02:55.658576'}
