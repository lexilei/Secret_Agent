THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To find the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP), we need the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. The patient's blood pressure is given as 125/70 mmHg in the note. The formula for MAP is: MAP = diastolic BP + (1/3)*(systolic BP - diastolic BP). Since we already have the necessary values, we can compute this directly without needing any additional tools.</thought>\n<answer>88.33</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:14:23.455796'}

TOTAL VIOLATIONS: 3
FAILED STEPS: []

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
