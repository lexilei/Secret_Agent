THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of first admission. The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, immobilization, recent surgery or trauma, previous PE/DVT, hemoptysis, and malignancy. However, the patient note does not provide explicit information on many of these factors. The patient was admitted with pyrexia, lethargy, myalgia, and night sweats, but there is no mention of DVT, hemoptysis, or malignancy. The patient's heart rate was normal (76 bpm), and there is no indication of recent surgery or trauma prior to admission. Given the lack of specific information, the Wells' score would likely be low, but without explicit data, it's challenging to assign a precise score. Since the required parameters for Wells' criteria are not extractable from the note, I cannot compute the score accurately.</thought>\n<answer>0.00</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:32:01.284885'}
