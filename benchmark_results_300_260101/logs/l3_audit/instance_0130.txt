THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the Wells' criteria components. The components include: clinical signs of DVT, heart rate > 100, hemoptysis, history of DVT/PE, malignancy, and whether PE is the most likely diagnosis. From the previous extraction, I have the pulse rate (96/min), but other components like history of DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and clinical signs of DVT were missing. The patient note does not mention hemoptysis, malignancy, or clinical signs of DVT, and there is no history of DVT/PE. The pulse rate is 96/min, which is below 100. The patient's symptoms (cough, fever) and findings (COPD, bronchiectasis) suggest an alternative diagnosis (respiratory infection) rather than PE. Therefore, the Wells' criteria score would be low.</thought>\n<answer>0.00</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T23:27:24.300832'}
