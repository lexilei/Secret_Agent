THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient\'s condition based on five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Here\'s how we can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient\'s chest pain is described as musculoskeletal (reproducible, non-exertional, localized), which is considered "slightly suspicious" (1 point).\n2. **ECG**: The ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment deviation or T-wave inversion, which is "normal" (0 points).\n3. **Age**: The patient is 57 years old, which is "≤65" (0 points).\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has a history of hypertension and a family history of premature coronary disease (father with MI in mid-50s). This counts as 1 risk factor (1 point).\n5. **Troponin**: The initial troponin is within the normal range (0 points).\n\nAdding these up: 1 (History) + 0 (ECG) + 0 (Age) + 1 (Risk factors) + 0 (Troponin) = 2 points total.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:25:47.895123'}
