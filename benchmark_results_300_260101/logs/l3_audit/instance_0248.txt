THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to assess the patient's risk factors based on the criteria. The RCRI includes the following risk factors:\n1. High-risk surgery (e.g., intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease\n3. History of congestive heart failure\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease\n5. Preoperative treatment with insulin\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The patient is undergoing a major vascular intervention (open repair of a 6.1 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm), which qualifies as a high-risk surgery.\n- The patient denies any history of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary stenting, or coronary artery bypass, so no history of ischemic heart disease.\n- The patient denies any history of congestive heart failure.\n- The patient has a history of a lacunar infarct (cerebrovascular disease).\n- The patient does not have diabetes and does not require insulin.\n- The patient's preoperative serum creatinine is 2.3 mg/dL (>2.0 mg/dL).\n\nThus, the patient has 3 risk factors: high-risk surgery, history of cerebrovascular disease, and preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-02T00:17:00.838469'}

AUDIT REPORTS:
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: has_steps - Trace must have at least one step

  - unknown: pass
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculation - LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
  - unknown: fail
      VIOLATION: attempted_calculator - LLM must attempt to use compute_calculation

REPAIR SUGGESTIONS:
  1. add_step: step_index=None
     Reason: Trace must have at least one step
  2. regenerate_step: step_index=None
     Reason: LLM must attempt to call compute_calculation
