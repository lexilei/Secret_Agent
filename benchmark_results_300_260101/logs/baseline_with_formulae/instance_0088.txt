Patient Note:
The case we present was a 71-year-old Japanese man. When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs –). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (“u” in Figure a, see also Figures –). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).
The patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).
The pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion. Thus, we succeeded in resecting the tumor in the ureteral orifice, which was accomplished via PDD using orally administered 5-ALA.

Question: What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m². You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
