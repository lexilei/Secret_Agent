Patient Note:
A 67-year-old woman presented to the pre-operative assessment clinic the afternoon before a scheduled open repair of a 6.1 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, an operation classified by the surgical team as a major vascular intervention given the anticipated cross-clamp time and retroperitoneal exposure. She was referred for medical clearance by her vascular surgeon after routine laboratory studies and chart review raised concern for possible peri-operative cardiac and renal risk. The patient ambulated into the office without dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal breathing disturbance, or peripheral edema, and she denied any history of nocturnal cough, frothy sputum, weight gain from fluid, or lower-extremity swelling. Her exercise tolerance was described as walking six city blocks at a moderate pace and climbing a single flight of household stairs while carrying groceries, limited more by occasional lumbar discomfort than by chest pressure or shortness of breath. She explicitly denied prior episodes of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass, or positive stress imaging. Review of vascular history, however, was notable for a lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata 4 years earlier, which had manifested with transient right-arm numbness and dysarthria that resolved fully within 48 hours following intravenous thrombolysis. Subsequent neurologic follow-up confirmed no residual weakness or speech deficit, and she remains on daily aspirin and a high-intensity statin for secondary prevention; she reports strict adherence and no bleeding complications. Her other chronic illnesses include well-controlled essential hypertension managed with losartan 100 mg each morning, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertensive nephrosclerosis with baseline creatinine values fluctuating between 1.8 and 2.1 mg/dL, and mixed dyslipidemia. She has never been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and therefore has never required insulin or other glucose-lowering agents; her most recent fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 93 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c was 5.6%. There is no personal or family history of congestive cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valvular disease, or congenital heart anomalies. She quit smoking 12 years ago after a 30-pack-year career and denies alcohol use or illicit substances. Medications taken on the morning of evaluation include losartan, amlodipine 5 mg, aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly, and cholecalciferol. On physical examination in the pre-operative suite she appeared comfortable and conversant, blood pressure was 138/72 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 74 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air, oral temperature 36.8 °C, and body mass index 28.4 kg/m². Jugular venous pulsation was not elevated, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and auscultation revealed a normal S1 and S2 with no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Lungs were clear to the bases, abdomen soft with a palpable pulsatile mass consistent with the known aneurysm but no tenderness, and peripheral pulses were 2+ bilaterally with warm extremities and intact neurologic function. Pre-operative laboratory panel drawn two hours earlier showed stable anemia with hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelets 235 ×10⁹/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 23 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 41 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, representing a slight rise from her last nephrology clinic visit but without accompanying oliguria or uremic symptoms. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, and no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram from eight months prior documented normal left ventricular size, concentric hypertrophy, and an ejection fraction of 60% without regional wall motion abnormality, valvular stenosis, or regurgitation. The patient expresses understanding of the need for the upcoming complex intra-abdominal operation to prevent aneurysmal rupture and is eager to proceed, requesting guidance on peri-operative cardiac surveillance and renal protection. After discussion of her stroke history, renal function, blood pressure control, and overall functional capacity, she agreed to continue her antihypertensives up to the morning of surgery, withhold the aspirin as directed by the vascular team, and undergo intra-operative arterial line placement for beat-to-beat monitoring.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
