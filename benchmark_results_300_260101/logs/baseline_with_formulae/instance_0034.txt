Patient Note:
A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with rapid onset of severe pain and swelling in his right great toe overnight. He reports experiencing a similar episode several years ago but cannot recall the diagnosis or the medication he was given for treatment. His medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, poorly controlled diabetes, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 5.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 259 mg/dL
Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

The interphalangeal joint of the right great toe is aspirated, with the synovial fluid aspirate shown under polarized light microscopy in Figure A.

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

================================================================================

To calculate the patient's GFR using the **2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation**, we use the following formula:  

**CKD-EPI GFR Formula:**  
\[ GFR = 142 \times \left(\frac{Scr}{A}\right)^B \times 0.9938^{age} \times \text{gender\_coef} \]  

### **Given Data:**  
- **Age:** 58 years  
- **Sex:** Male (gender coefficient = 1.0 if male, 1.012 if female)  
- **Serum Creatinine (Scr):** 3.1 mg/dL  
- **Race:** Not specified (assumed non-Black, coefficient = 1.0)  

### **Steps:**  
1. **Determine A and B:**  
   - For males, **A = 0.9**, **B = -0.302** (if Scr ≤ 0.9)  
   - Since Scr (3.1) > 0.9, **B = -1.200**  

2. **Plug into the formula:**  
   \[ GFR = 142 \times \left(\frac{3.1}{0.9}\right)^{-1.200} \times 0.9938^{58} \times 1.0 \]  

3. **Calculate:**  
   - \(\left(\frac{3.1}{0.9}\right)^{-1.200} = (3.444)^{-1.200} ≈ 0.197\)  
   - \(0.9938^{58} ≈ 0.712\)  
   - \(GFR = 142 \times 0.197 \times 0.712 ≈ 19.9\)  

### **Final Answer:**  
**19.9**
