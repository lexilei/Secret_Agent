Patient Note:
A 78-year-old man was evaluated this afternoon in the peri-operative medicine clinic at the request of the orthopedic team in anticipation of next week’s elective right total knee arthroplasty for end-stage tricompartmental osteoarthritis causing severe mechanical pain and limitation of ambulation; the procedure is planned under regional anesthesia with a projected operative time of 90 minutes and an overnight hospital stay. He reports that over the past several years the gradual deterioration of his knee has obliged him to use a single-point cane for outdoor walking, and his activity tolerance is roughly two level city blocks at a slow pace before he must pause because of joint discomfort rather than breathlessness or chest pressure. Eight months ago he required admission for worsening lower-extremity swelling and exertional dyspnea that responded to intravenous loop diuretics, and a transthoracic echocardiogram obtained during that hospitalization showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 % with mild global hypokinesis; since discharge he has remained clinically compensated on carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and torsemide 20 mg each morning, with no further episodes of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or unplanned clinic visits. For secondary stroke prevention, he takes aspirin 81 mg daily and high-intensity atorvastatin after suffering a small left thalamic infarct three years prior that initially produced transient gait ataxia; he completed outpatient physical therapy, denies any residual focal weakness, and has experienced no recurrent neurologic symptoms such as acute visual changes, speech disturbance, or unilateral numbness. Other long-standing conditions include well-controlled hypertension, stage 3 chronic kidney disease attributed to long-standing vascular disease and prior exposure to intravenous contrast, and hyperlipidemia; he has never been told he has diabetes mellitus and his last fasting plasma glucose six months ago was 101 mg/dL. He quit smoking more than two decades ago after a 25-pack-year history, drinks a glass of red wine with dinner most evenings, and denies illicit drug use. Current home medications also comprise amlodipine 5 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg each morning, vitamin D supplementation, and as-needed acetaminophen for knee pain; no drug allergies are reported. Family history is notable for a brother with heart failure and a mother who sustained a cerebrovascular accident in her 70s; there is no early coronary disease in first-degree relatives. On examination today he appeared comfortable seated in the clinic chair, conversant, and euvolemic. Vital signs: blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg in the right arm seated, heart rate 68 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97 % on ambient air, oral temperature 36.7 °C, and body mass index 29 kg/m². Neck veins were not distended at 45°, carotid upstrokes were brisk without bruit, and the precordial exam revealed a displaced apical impulse and a soft third heart sound without murmurs or pericardial rub. Lung fields were clear to auscultation with no crackles or wheezes, abdomen was soft and non-tender without organomegaly, and 1+ bilateral ankle pitting edema was present. Neurologic assessment demonstrated intact cranial nerves, full strength, normal coordination, and steady gait with a cane. Pre-operative laboratory studies drawn this morning revealed hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit 36 %, white blood cell count 7.4 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 215 × 10⁹/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, which is consistent with his baseline values over the past year; estimated glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI equation calculates to 48 mL/min/1.73 m². Random glucose in clinic measured 104 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria and no acute ST-T changes. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed six weeks ago at his cardiology follow-up confirmed the prior ejection fraction with stable dimensions, mild concentric hypertrophy, trace mitral regurgitation, and normal right ventricular function. Chest radiograph obtained today shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette without pulmonary venous congestion or interstitial edema. He describes adherence to a low-sodium diet, weighs himself daily, and has not required an increase in diuretic dosing for the past four months. Functional capacity on the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire corresponds to approximately 4 metabolic equivalents, limited primarily by knee pain. The anesthesia service has assessed his airway as Mallampati class II with intact dentition and normal cervical spine mobility; spinal anesthesia with femoral nerve block is favored, and an arterial line is not anticipated. The orthopedic surgeon has requested that beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy be continued through the morning of surgery, whereas the diuretic will be held the day of operation to reduce the risk of intravascular depletion; aspirin will be stopped five days prior per regional anesthesia protocol, and atorvastatin will be continued. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis will consist of mechanical compression intra-operatively followed by low-dose subcutaneous anticoagulation post-operatively once hemostasis is assured. The patient verbalizes clear understanding of the surgical plan, anticipated recovery course, potential cardiac and neurologic risks, and strategies to mitigate postoperative fluid shifts, and he remains eager to proceed in hopes of regaining the ability to walk without assistive devices.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
