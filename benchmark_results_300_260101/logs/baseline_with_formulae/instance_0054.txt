Patient Note:
The patient was a 64-year-old man affected by a persistent nodular lesion of the cheek mucosa. More precisely, he presented with a blue-violet, sessile, painless, and nonbleeding lesion of the cheek lasting one year (Figure ). He reported occasional biting trauma. Warfarin therapy had been prescribed for the patient for chronic atrial fibrillation. The clinical diagnosis was of venous malformation, as confirmed by ultrasound investigation. Following a careful explanation of the treatment, the patient agreed to transmucosal photocoagulation by DL without suspension of warfarin treatment. After a small amount of local anesthesia, we used the DL (wavelength 910 ± 10 nm; pulsed-wave; fiber of 400 microns; output energy 5 W) to directly photocoagulate the lesion, and the treatment ended when its color varied from blue-violet to grayish-white (Figure ). The irradiated area healed in 14 days without recurrence (Figure ).

Question: What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
