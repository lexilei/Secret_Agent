Patient Note:
A 70-year-old white woman with a renal transplant performed nine years ago arrived at the emergency room with a dry cough and minimal activity dyspnea. She had no fever, expectoration, or chest pain.
She had been diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia and the origin of the kidney disease was unknown. Before transplantation in 2007, she received hemodialysis for two years due to a right brachiocephalic fistula. In 2012, the brachiocephalic fistula was closed as a consequence of an aneurysm and during the last year she suffered from local pain which was treated with pregabalin and opiates, with no local complications observed. The immunosuppression drugs administered to the patient were tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. The renal function remained stable with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL). After transplantation, she suffered from continuous urinary tract infections that were treated with antibiotics, and after a urologic evaluation in 2012, a left kidney nephrectomy was performed because of a pyelonephritis. In March 2015, an anterior colporrhaphy and posterior perineoplasty were also performed to correct a cystocele.
In March 2016, at admission, blood pressure was 159/92 mmHg, temperature was 36°C, and arterial oxygen saturation was 94%. A clinical examination revealed 20 breaths per minute, wheezing and basal hypoventilation, fistula pain, and ankle swelling. The rest of the physical examination was strictly normal with no local findings in the AV-fistula area. Lab tests showed normal C-reactive protein level of 0.77 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0–1.0 mg/dL), serum creatinine of 1.38 mg/dL, and leucocytes count of 7670 (normal range: 4000–11500); PCR herpes viruses 6, 7, and 8 were negative and so were galactomannan antigen, H1N1, and influenza B virus smear. Blood and urine culture were negative as well as cytomegalovirus PCR.
The initial workup showed a diffuse interstitial-alveolar pattern in the chest radiography and hence a piperacillin-tazobactam and a bronchodilator treatment was initiated. The first CT revealed peripheral bilateral infiltrates and minimum pleural effusion. After completing antibiotic therapy, the patient did not improve and a bronchoscopy was performed which showed no atypical cells or signs of infection. BAL and pleural effusion were also tested and were negative for infection and showed no malignancy. A second CT revealed worsening of the infiltrates and pleural thickening which suggested neoplasia. A pulmonary biopsy by videothoracoscopy was performed. It was of an excellent quality and revealed a good representation of the pleura (parietal and visceral), pulmonary parenchyma, vascular areas, and airways.
A first examination of the histologic sections showed a tumor characterized by atypical cells with vascular affectation that invaded the visceral pleura. There were multiple nodular neoformations with hemorrhagic areas showing a circumferential growth that affected blood vessels and bronchioles, which extended to adjacent areas and to the subpleural pulmonary interstitium. Vimentin stain, CD34, CD31, and VIII factor all resulted to be positive. The expression of herpes virus 8 was negative. These results suggested a metastatic mesenchymal tumor. Subsequently, a right arm arteriography revealed a 7 cm mass in the brachiocephalic fistula (Figures and ) and a biopsy was performed that was compatible with epitheliod angiosarcoma (). The diagnosis of an arteriovenous fistula angiosarcoma with pulmonary metastasis was carried out.

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

RESPONSE
================================================================================

To calculate the patient's GFR using the **2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation**, we need the following information from the patient note:  

- **Age**: 70 years  
- **Sex**: Female  
- **Serum Creatinine (Scr)**: 1.38 mg/dL  
- **Race**: White (no adjustment needed for Black race)  

### **CKD-EPI 2021 Equation (for females, non-Black):**  
\[  
GFR = 142 \times \left(\frac{Scr}{0.7}\right)^{-0.241} \times 0.9938^{age}  
\]  

### **Calculation Steps:**  
1. **Normalize Scr (divide by 0.7):**  
   \[  
   \frac{1.38}{0.7} = 1.971  
   \]  
2. **Apply exponent (-0.241):**  
   \[  
   1.971^{-0.241} ≈ 0.853  
   \]  
3. **Multiply by 142:**  
   \[  
   142 \times 0.853 ≈ 121.1  
   \]  
4. **Age adjustment (0.9938^70):**  
   \[  
   0.9938^{70} ≈ 0.618  
   \]  
5. **Final GFR:**  
   \[  
   121.1 \times 0.618 ≈ 74.8  
   \]  

**Answer:**  
74.8
