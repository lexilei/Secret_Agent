Patient Note:
A 57-year-old woman (180 cm, 60 kg) was presented to the emergency department with upper abdominal pain and left-sided chest discomfort for a couple of days. In addition, she reported of nausea. Upon physical examination, percussion sounds over the left lower thorax were a bit dull and cervical lymph nodes were palpable with a size of up to 1 cm. The abdomen was generally tender without signs of peritonitis; bowel sounds were normal. The ECG showed no abnormalities. Routine laboratory tests revealed mild leucocytosis and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level. Troponin, myoglobine, and creatine kinase levels were within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. Whereas the oesophagus, the lower stomach, and the duodenum were
without abnormalities, a small hole in the fundus was visible after inversion of the scope ().
The “hole in the stomach” was intubated with a catheter and contrast dye was administered. Fluoroscopy revealed a diaphragmatic hernia with a large herniation of the gastric fundus (). Immediate laparotomy showed a 3 cm orifice of the
diaphragm (). The orifice was widened and a partial necrosis of the incarcerated fundus was resected (). The diaphragmatic orifice was covered with polydioxanone. The patient recovered fully and 
was discharged 12 days after laparotomy.

Question: What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m². You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
