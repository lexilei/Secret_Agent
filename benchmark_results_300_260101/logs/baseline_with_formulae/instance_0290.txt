Patient Note:
A 60-year-old man diagnosed with CHC was referred to the outpatient clinic for antiviral therapy in January 13, 2004. Initial laboratory data were as follows: WBC of 6,200/μL, hemoglobin of 16.0 g/dL, platelet count of 106,300/μL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, AST level of 182 IU/L, ALT level of 238 IU/L, total bilirubin level of 1.1 mg/dL, albumin level of 4.2 g/dL, and prothrombin time of 1.07 INR. The HBsAg and anti-HBs were negative, but anti-HCV was positive. The level of HCV RNA was 2.26×105 copies/ml and HCV genotype was 2a.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed presence of F1 esophageal varices on the lower esophagus and portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Abdominal ultrasonography showed coarse echogenicity of the liver parenchyma and mild splenomegaly (long axis of spleen, 10.2 cm) []. He was treated with interferon alpha and ribavirin combination for 24 weeks and achieved SVR. During follow up, esophageal varices decreased in size () and completely regressed after 8 years of SVR (). The spleen size decreased to 8.9 cm and platelet counts increased to 256,000/μL after 8 years of SVR.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
