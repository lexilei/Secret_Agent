Patient Note:
A 52-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of abnormal accumulation at the distal metaphysis of the left radius on an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan taken for follow-up after renal cancer. The patient had a history of CKD due to microvascular nephrotic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. The patient had undergone a unilateral partial nephrectomy for renal cancer three years before and had not experienced any recurrence or metastasis.
At the time of the initial examination, there was no obvious swelling or tenderness in the distal part of his left forearm and no restriction in the range of wrist motion. Laboratory data showed slightly low levels of various electrolytes in addition to renal dysfunction, consistent with the hemodialysis state, with no other noteworthy findings: Na 134mEq/L, K 3.2mEq/L, Cl 92mEq/L, Ca 7.4mg/dL, BUN 75.0mg/dL, Cr 10.01mg/dL.
A geographic radiolucent lesion with sclerotic margins was found in the radiographs taken at the initial consultation (Figure ). The tumor measured about 5 cm, and the bone cortex was thinned and expanded due to tumor growth. Computed tomography (CT) images showed no calcification inside the tumor, and the bone cortex appeared to be partially disrupted (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed homogeneous isointense signals in the T1-weighted images and heterogeneously mixed iso- and high-signals in the T2-weighted images (Figure ). The FDG-PET scan revealed high accumulation in the left distal radial metaphysis (Figure ).
One month after the initial visit, an incisional biopsy of the tumor was performed with the possibility of a low-grade malignancy based on the imaging findings. Tissue samples were collected by making a hole on the bone cortex just subjacent to the first compartment of the extensor tendon sheath. After the biopsy, the bone hole was filled with cement, the tendon sheath was repaired, and the procedure was completed. The collected samples were brownish (Figure ). The pathological findings of the tissue revealed numerous multinucleated giant cells and no atypical cells, leading to the diagnosis of GCTB (Figure ).
The patient was scheduled to undergo tumor curettage. Administration of denosumab may be a treatment option, but was not indicated because of the frequent hypocalcemia at different times caused by CKD. However, X-rays and CT images taken again before surgery showed osteogenic signs in the tumor (Figure ). Usually, GCTB do not show osteogenesis in their natural course. Therefore, it was necessary to reconsider the diagnosis of the biopsy specimen.
Reviewing the laboratory data, the intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was abnormally high (915.4 pg/mL) at the time of the initiation of peritoneal dialysis four months before the initial visit. Thereafter, the value of intact PTH decreased to within the normal range (20.0 pg/mL). These laboratory data are shown in Table . These data suggested a possible association between PTH and tumor behavior.
We decided to perform a re-biopsy instead of curettage in order to confirm the pathological diagnosis. The newly collected samples were white tissue with a light pinkish color (Figure ), differing from those of the previous biopsy. The pathological findings of re-biopsy specimens showed the almost complete disappearance of multinucleated giant cells and mature bone tissue, with no obvious neoplastic changes or malignant images (Figure ). The osteogenic changes and the disappearance of the giant cells indicated that the tumor was a BT. The patient was followed up by clinical images every six months. One year after the biopsy, the radiographic images showed further osteogenesis and the lesion was considered almost healed (Figure ).

Question: Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? If the patient is black, please use the MDRD GFR Equation for Blacks. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

RESPONSE
================================================================================

To calculate the patient's GFR using the MDRD equation, we need the following information from the patient note:  

- **Serum Creatinine (Scr):** 10.01 mg/dL  
- **Age:** 52 years  
- **Gender:** Male (gender coefficient = 1)  
- **Race:** Not specified as black (so no additional adjustment)  

The **MDRD GFR equation** is:  
\[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times \text{Scr}^{-1.154} \times \text{age}^{-0.203} \times \text{gender coefficient} \]  

Plugging in the values:  
\[ \text{GFR} = 175 \times (10.01)^{-1.154} \times (52)^{-0.203} \times 1 \]  

Calculating step-by-step:  
1. \( 10.01^{-1.154} ≈ 0.071 \)  
2. \( 52^{-0.203} ≈ 0.715 \)  
3. \( 175 \times 0.071 \times 0.715 ≈ 8.9 \)  

Since the patient is not specified as black, we do not multiply by 1.212.  

Final answer:  

**8.9**
