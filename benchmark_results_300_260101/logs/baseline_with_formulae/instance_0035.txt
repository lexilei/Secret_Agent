Patient Note:
A 33-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after she found out she had a blood pressure of 165/100 mmHg at a local pharmacy. The patient is not followed by a primary care physician and is not currently taking any medications. She has no other complaints at this time. A bedside ultrasound with Doppler of the abdomen is within normal limits. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

The patient is given hydrochlorothiazide and sent home. An ECG performed at a subsequent follow up appointment is seen in Figure A.

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.

RESPONSE
================================================================================

To calculate the patient's GFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, we need the following information from the patient note:

- Age: 33 years  
- Sex: Female (gender coefficient = 0.8 for females in the CKD-EPI equation)  
- Serum Creatinine (Scr): 1.1 mg/dL  

The 2021 CKD-EPI equation for females is:  
\[ GFR = 142 \times \left(\frac{Scr}{0.7}\right)^{-0.241} \times 0.9938^{age} \times 1.012 \]  

Plugging in the values:  
\[ GFR = 142 \times \left(\frac{1.1}{0.7}\right)^{-0.241} \times 0.9938^{33} \times 1.012 \]  

After performing the calculation:  

**Answer:** 78
