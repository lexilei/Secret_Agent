Patient Note:
A 66-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chronic weakness, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and left flank pain. Comorbidities included hypertension, active smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, or any shortness of breath. He had a recent admission due to community acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. He denied using any illicit drugs or alcohol abuse. He was retired truck driver by profession.
On examination, he was an elderly man with clinical signs of dehydration. Blood pressure was 155/56 mm Hg, heart rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 16/min, was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. He had mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rigidity. He had bilateral lower extremities chronic skin changes with scaling. The rest of the physical examination was normal.
Significant laboratory data revealed serum sodium 124 mEq/mL, potassium 5.1 mEq/mL, chloride 89 mEq/mL, bicarbonate 15 mEq/mL, blood urea nitrogen 44 mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, glucose 85 mg/dL, calcium 10.3 mg/dL, total protein 7.3 g/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL. The rest of the liver function tests were within normal limit. Anemia was with hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, platelets 558 k/μL, and white blood cells 10.4 k/μL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 25 mm Hg, pO2 of 90.3 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 μ/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.
Chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.
Initially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.
A temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.
Patient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition. Hospital course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and eventual death a month into his hospital stay.

Question: Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL? Your may set your normal albumin concentration to be 4 g/dL. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
