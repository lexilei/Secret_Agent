Patient Note:
A 64-year-old post-menopausal woman presented to the emergency ward late this afternoon complaining that her left lower limb had “ballooned” over the preceding twenty-four hours. She explained that two weeks earlier she was admitted to a community hospital for an influenza-associated pneumonia that required intravenous antibiotics and supplemental oxygen; although she never needed ventilatory support, she remained largely confined to bed in a monitored room for five consecutive days and afterwards spent another four days at home reclining on a couch because of lingering fatigue. She finally felt strong enough yesterday to attempt household chores and, upon standing, immediately perceived a dragging heaviness in the entire left leg from groin to ankle, accompanied by a dull ache that intensified when she tried to climb stairs. She denied any isolated trauma to the hip, thigh, knee, or calf, and has not noticed erythematous streaking, pruritus, insect bites, fluctuance, or ulcers. There was no antecedent long-haul automobile or air travel, she has not worn an orthopedic boot or cast, and she retains full voluntary movement of both legs without sensory loss or weakness. Past medical history is notable for well-controlled type 2 diabetes and stage 1 hypertension, managed respectively with metformin 1000 mg twice daily and lisinopril 10 mg every morning; she has never experienced venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy eight years ago and a screening colonoscopy last year, and there have been no operative procedures, endoscopies, or invasive joint injections since. Medications do not include estrogen preparations, glucocorticoids, selective SERMs, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or anticoagulants. She quit smoking fifteen years ago after a 20-pack-year history, drinks one glass of wine on special occasions, and has never used illicit drugs. Family history is negative for hereditary coagulopathies, premature coronary disease, or malignancy. Review of systems elicited no fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, palpitations, abdominal distension, or urinary complaints. Upon arrival her vital signs were temperature 36.9 °C, blood pressure 138/82 mm Hg, heart rate 88 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation 98 % on ambient air. She sat upright without respiratory distress and conversed in full sentences. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops; lung fields were clear to auscultation and percussion throughout. The abdomen was soft with normoactive bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Examination of the lower extremities was remarkable for striking asymmetry: the left limb, from the proximal thigh to the dorsum of the foot, appeared uniformly enlarged with a glossy sheen to the skin; the thigh circumference at mid-femur exceeded that of the right by several centimeters, and the calf and ankle were similarly prominent, though an exact tape measurement was deferred until after imaging to avoid unnecessarily manipulating the limb. A lattice of bluish, non-tortuous superficial channels was conspicuous along the medial thigh and posterior calf and became more distended when the leg was placed in a dependent position for thirty seconds. Gentle thumb pressure over the anterior tibia produced an immediate rebound with no lasting indentation, and comparable pressure over the contralateral side yielded identical findings, indicating the swelling was not of a pitting character. Palpation of the femoral triangle, adductor canal, popliteal fossa, and posterior compartment elicited a vague pressure sensation but no discrete focal tenderness or palpable cord. Knee and ankle joints moved through full active and passive ranges without crepitus, effusion, or localized warmth. Distal pulses—dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial—were 2 + and symmetric, capillary refill was less than two seconds, and cutaneous sensation to light touch and pinprick remained intact bilaterally. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy, no groin masses, and the contralateral limb was completely normal in contour, temperature, and color. Point-of-care laboratory studies drawn prior to any pharmacologic intervention revealed hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, platelet count 254 × 10⁹/L, white-cell count 7.1 × 10⁹/L, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 4.1 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, and an international normalized ratio of 1.0; liver enzymes were within reference limits. An electrocardiogram displayed normal sinus rhythm at 86 beats/minute without ST-T abnormalities. The history of prolonged recumbency exceeding three days, the global enlargement of the entire symptomatic extremity, the emergence of conspicuous collateral superficial veins, the absence of pitting edema, absence of neurologic impairment or casting, and the lack of any recent surgery, cellulitis, lymphedema, or musculoskeletal injury that could equally account for the presentation make an intraluminal obstructive process within the deep venous system the leading consideration, and a duplex ultrasound from the iliac segment to the ankle has been requested on an urgent basis while anticoagulation decisions await imaging confirmation.

Question: What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
