Patient Note:
A 43-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of melena for three days.
He had two loose bowel movements with black tarry stool every day for the last three days with lightheadedness.
He denies any hematemesis, abdominal pain, or similar episodes in the past.
Past medical history was remarkable for liver cirrhosis due to untreated hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. Family history was unremarkable.
On presentation, vitals revealed a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg; pulse rate of 110 per minute, temperature of 98.5 Fahrenheit, and respiratory rate of 18 per minute. Physical exam revealed an ill-looking patient with mild confusion, pale conjunctiva, non-icterus sclera, mildly distended abdomen with no tenderness, and trace pitting edema in both legs. US revealed small fluid collections around the liver edge.
Laboratory findings displayed hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL, leukocytes 10000/mm3, and platelet 105000/mm3. Serum biochemistry revealed creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, total protein 4.8 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 34 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 60 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 95 IU/L, international normalized ratio 1.1 and total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL.

Question: What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
