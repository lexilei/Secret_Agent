Patient Note:
A 47-year-old man with a past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis and ongoing alcohol abuse was brought to the emergency room after a syncopal episode. He complained of 7/10 epigastric pain associated with nonbloody emesis. He denied melena. He was tachycardic with a heart rate of 108 as well as hypotensive with a blood pressure of 64/34. His oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. He was alert with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 14 but noted to be in severe distress, diaphoretic, and tremulous. His skin was cold and clammy and abdomen was noted to be distended and diffusely tender to palpation. A rectal exam was negative for gross blood. A FAST exam noted moderate ascites. A chest X-ray was performed and was negative for acute pathology.
Relevant laboratory data on admission included the following: white blood cell count of 7600 per mm3, bands of 38%, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl, platelet count of 149,000 per mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 213 U/liter, and alanine aminotransferase of 309 U/liter. Initial venous blood gas revealed a pH of 7.23, a venous bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/liter and a lactate of 6.62 mmol/liter.
Despite four liters of intravenous crystalloid fluid resuscitation the patient remained hypotensive at 75/58. Vasopressor support was initiated with intravenous norepinephrine titrated to a dose of 30 mcg/min and vasopressin at 0.04 units/min with minimal improvement in blood pressure to 94/76. Broad spectrum antibiotics consisting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were administered due to concerns for septic shock. SBP was considered the cause of sepsis due to patient's abdominal pain, ascites, and bandemia.
The patient became increasingly more confused and agitated and the trachea was electively intubated for airway control. During this time, his abdomen was noted to be more distended. Patient was deemed too unstable for abdominal CT imaging as he was requiring multiple vasopressors. Postintubation he was transferred to the medical ICU for presumed septic shock.
On arrival to the ICU after initial stabilization of the patient a diagnostic paracentesis was performed in order to obtain culture for possible SBP. An appropriate pocket of fluid was visualized in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Approximately five ml of bloody ascites was aspirated. Concurrently, repeat lab results reported a hemoglobin level of 4.4 g/dl and an arterial blood gas with a lactate of 12.92 mmol/liter. General surgery was immediately consulted due to concerns for intraabdominal hemorrhage. At the same time the patient's girlfriend arrived to the hospital and stated that the patient had complained of falling in the bathroom earlier that day. General surgery recommended angiogram to locate the source of suspected intraabdominal bleeding. Interventional radiology was contacted for emergent angiogram to evaluate for a hepatic or splenic hemorrhage. Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and intravenous epinephrine was added to norepinephrine and vasopressin due to persistent hypotension. He was transferred to the IR suite.
The right common femoral artery was accessed and an angiogram was performed initially finding vague contrast blush in the right hepatic lobe which was empirically embolized with Gelfoam and detachable coils. There was extensive contrast extravasation from the distal splenic artery (). The splenic artery was embolized and angiogram postembolization demonstrated no further contrast extravasation (). Patient's blood pressure increased from 70 systolic to 100 immediately after embolization. On examination post angiogram, his abdomen was tense. Patient was also oliguric therefore, the decision was made to take him immediately for exploratory laparotomy for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a cirrhotic liver without signs of injury and a two-centimeter grade 1 splenic laceration at the lower pole which was not actively bleeding. A total of nine liters of bloody ascites were evacuated from the abdomen. The abdomen was left open and a Bogota bag was sutured to the fascia. He was transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and a unit of platelets during the procedure.
He was brought back to the operating room (OR) two days later and was found to have active bleeding at the anterior surface of the hilum of the spleen. This was cauterized, stopping the bleeding. On hospital day four he was taken back to the OR and the abdomen was closed. He was extubated on hospital day seven. Hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury which resolved, as well as seizures attributed to alcohol withdrawal treated with chlordiazepoxide. Patient was discharged home and at a clinic follow-up two months post hospitalization he was noted to be doing well and abstaining from alcohol.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
