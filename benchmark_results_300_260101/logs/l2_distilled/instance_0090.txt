Patient Note:
A 51-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for renal biopsy. Proteinuria had been detected when the patient was approximately 30 years of age, and he had experienced tonsillitis several times. The patient had been diagnosed with PV with an abnormality of the JAK2 gene 3 years earlier. Renal biopsy was planned because his proteinuria had become more apparent over the past 2 years.
The patient’s height, weight, and blood pressure were 165 cm, 66 kg, and 120/73 mmHg, respectively. His consciousness level was alert, and he appeared healthy. No remarkable abnormalities were found in the heart, lungs, or abdomen, and pitting edema was not observed.
The laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin, 15.3 g/dl; hematocrit, 48.1 %; platelets, 326,000/μl; white blood cells, 8,400/μl; C-reactive protein, <0.2 mg/dl; blood urea nitrogen, 22.2 mg/dl; serum creatinine, 1.4 mg/dl; total cholesterol, 194 mg/dl; total protein, 7.1 g/dl; albumin, 4.1 g/dl; globulin, 3.0 g/dl; lactate dehydrogenase, 169 IU/l; aspartate aminotransferase, 17 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 23 IU/l; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 21 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 276 IU/l; Na, 139 mmol/l; K, 4.7 mmol/l; and Cl, 106 mmol/l. Urinalysis showed 4+ proteinuria (1.2 g/day) and no evidence of hematuria.
Renal biopsy was performed (Fig. ) and 22 glomeruli could be evaluated, 5 of which showed global sclerosis. Histological findings included mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents and focal segmental necrosis. Arteriosclerotic changes were also observed. Immunofluorescence staining was positive and revealed strong immunoreactivity for IgA and C3. Electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the mesangium. He was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. Tonsillectomy plus steroid pulse therapy and an angiotensin II receptor blocker were selected as treatments for the patient. His proteinuria and hematuria disappeared after 6 months.

Question: What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)? Your answer should be in terms of kg/m². You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
