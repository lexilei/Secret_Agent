Patient Note:
A 73-year-old Caucasian male presented with longstanding chronic kidney disease (CKD) G2
related to arterial hypertension stage II. Past medical history: prostate cancer and
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) IgG k, rosacea dermatitis, right
hand arthritis.
Laboratory tests () showed normal
complete blood count (CBC), normal serum calcium value, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, B type
natriuretic peptide (BNP) 161 pg/mL, proteinuria 946 mg/24 h, albuminuria 200 mg/dL. His
serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFE) revealed a monoclonal IgG k
M-protein at 2 g/dL. Twenty-four-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) demonstrated
positive k light chain proteinuria, Bence Jones Proteinuria (BJP). Kappa serum free light
chain (FLC) was 126 mg/dL (normal range 0,330-1,940 mg/dL) and lambda serum FLC was 0.858
mg/dL (normal range 0.571-2.630 mg/dL) with kappa/lambda ratio at 146 (normal range
0.26-1.65).
Bone skeletal survey didn’t detect osteolytic bone lesion.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed plasmocytosis with scatted CD138+ plasma cells at 30% (Congo
red staining not evaluated). We assessed amyloidosis as a concomitant CKD’s cause:
Congo red staining test on fat pad biopsy was positive. Immunogold on fat pad sample
revealed transthyretin (ATTR) and serum amyloid A (SAA) amyloidosis. We screened for genetic
mutations: the patient was affected by wild type form of the disease (wtATTR) ().
The patient didn’t have systemic AL amyloidosis. The value of FLC ratio above 100
was confirmed in serial testing. This is an IMWG criteria for treatment (FLC ratio >100 with
concomitant FLC k >100 mg/L), but in this case, treatment was delayed and FLC ratio
monitored.
In clinical practice it is a common error to assume AL primary amyloidosis in patients
presenting with monoclonal gammopathy. Rheumatologic assessment in order to identify
underlying cause of SAA amyloid will be needed, considering patient history of rosacea
dermatitis and hand arthritis. As a result of the correct diagnosis being made, the
prognosis was much more favorable. It is known the high prevalence of coexistent MGUS with
ATTR amyloidosis in the elderly population. The incidence of MGUS in wild type TTR cardiac
amyloidosis is 23%; moreover, it could be not uncommon to discover a plasma cell
disorder in patients with SAA amyloid, given the increasing incidence of both conditions
with chronic inflammatory disease.

Question: Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? If the patient is black, please use the MDRD GFR Equation for Blacks. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
