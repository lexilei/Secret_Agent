THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. Each component is scored from 0 to 2, and the total score ranges from 0 to 10. Here's how we can break it down for this patient:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a concerning history of chest pain (pressure-like, tightness, 7/10 severity, lasting 5-6 minutes, radiating to the back). This is highly suspicious and would score 2 points.\n2. **EKG**: The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic changes, which scores 0 points.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 37 years old, which is less than 45, so this scores 0 points.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient is morbidly obese, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. This would score 1 point.\n5. **Troponin**: The serial high sensitivity troponin was elevated (440>606>872 ng/mL), which is significantly above the normal range (0-0.4 ng/mL). This would score 2 points.\n\nAdding these up: 2 (History) + 0 (EKG) + 0 (Age) + 1 (Risk factors) + 2 (Troponin) = 5 points.</thought>\n<answer>5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:00.951213'}
