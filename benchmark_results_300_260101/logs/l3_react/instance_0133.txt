THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission. However, the available calculators do not include Wells' criteria directly. The task requires evaluating specific clinical features such as signs of DVT, tachycardia, hemoptysis, etc., which are not explicitly mentioned in the patient note. Since the necessary information is not available, I cannot compute the Wells' score.</thought>\n<answer>N/A</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:07:31.657719'}
