THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to identify the following risk factors from the patient note:\n1. High-risk surgery (infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is considered high-risk)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction seven years ago)\n3. History of congestive heart failure (none mentioned)\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease (none mentioned)\n5. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin (the patient has type 2 diabetes but does not use insulin)\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (the patient's creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL)\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The patient is undergoing a high-risk surgery (infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair).\n- The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (ischemic heart disease).\n- No history of congestive heart failure or cerebrovascular disease.\n- The patient has diabetes but does not require insulin.\n- Preoperative serum creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL (<2.0 mg/dL).\n\nThus, the patient has 2 risk factors: high-risk surgery and history of ischemic heart disease. The RCRI score is the sum of these risk factors.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:55.537718'}
