THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical factors such as active cancer, paralysis or recent immobilization, recent surgery or bed rest, localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep veins, entire leg swelling, calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg, pitting edema, collateral superficial veins, and an alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, I can extract the following relevant information:\n1. The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and recent C. diff infection.\n2. He presented with worsening abdominal and rectal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematochezia.\n3. He had no recent history of antibiotic use or other triggering factors for C. diff infection.\n4. His initial vitals were stable, and his physical exam did not show signs of DVT (no mention of leg swelling, tenderness, or pitting edema).\n5. He was diagnosed with rectal perforation secondary to C. diff colitis and underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy.\n\nBased on this information, the patient does not meet any of the Wells' criteria for DVT at the time of admission. There is no mention of leg swelling, tenderness, or other signs of DVT. The patient's symptoms and diagnosis were related to his UC and C. diff infection, not DVT.\n\nTherefore, the Wells' criteria score for DVT is 0.</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:42:18.255720'}
