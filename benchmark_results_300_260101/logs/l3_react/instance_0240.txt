THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient's medical history and current symptoms against the Wells' criteria. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific point value. The criteria are as follows:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): +1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: +1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: +1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: +1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen: +1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): +1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg): +1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): +1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT: -2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, I can extract the following relevant information:\n- The patient was recently bedridden for more than 3 days (5 days in the hospital and 4 days at home): +1 point\n- The entire left leg is swollen: +1 point\n- There is no pitting edema: 0 points\n- Collateral superficial veins are present: +1 point\n- No alternative diagnosis is mentioned as likely or more likely than DVT: 0 points (no subtraction)\n- No active cancer, paralysis, or recent plaster immobilization: 0 points\n- No localized tenderness along the deep venous system: 0 points\n- No calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (though asymmetry is noted, exact measurement is deferred): 0 points\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (bedridden) + 1 (entire leg swollen) + 1 (collateral veins) = 3 points.\n\nThe Wells' criteria score for this patient is 3.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:50.679045'}
