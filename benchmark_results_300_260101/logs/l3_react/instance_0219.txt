Head and neck examinations were unremarkable except for anemic conjunctiva. Her abdomen was distended with shifting dullness and the spleen was palpable. Initial laboratory data were as follows: WBC 1,400/mm3, Hb 5.1 g/dL, platelet 63,000/mm3, BUN 19 mg/dL, creatinine 0.48 mg/dL, albumin 3.0 g/dL, AST 26 IU/L, ALT 20 IU/L, ALP 47 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.73 mg/dL, INR 1.45, CRP 0.08 mg/dL, AFP 2.4 ng/dL. The hepatitis B marker was negative and the anti HCV antibody was positive. A hepatitis C viral load was undetectable. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) pantoprazole, IV terlipressin and IV ciprofloxacin and was transfused with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed the presence of grade 2 esophageal varices without stigmata of recent bleeding. No bleeding focus was found at colonoscopy up to the terminal ileum.

On day six of hospitalization, a decision was made to perform the embolization of varices via the portal vein. The guidewire was manipulated into the superior mesenteric vein and the catheter tip was then positioned into tortuous, wide jejunal varices drained to the inferior vena cava.
