THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to assess the patient's risk factors based on the following criteria:\n1. High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease (including MI or current angina)\n3. History of congestive heart failure\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA)\n5. Preoperative insulin treatment for diabetes\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The surgery is an elective right inguinal herniorrhaphy, which is not considered high-risk.\n- The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) eight years ago, which counts as ischemic heart disease.\n- There is no history of congestive heart failure or cerebrovascular disease.\n- The patient is on metformin for diabetes but does not require insulin.\n- The preoperative serum creatinine is 2.1 mg/dL, which is >2.0 mg/dL.\n\nThus, the patient has 2 risk factors: history of ischemic heart disease and preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:44:55.424218'}
