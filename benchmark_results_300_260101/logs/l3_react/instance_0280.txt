{'content': '<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, I need to evaluate the patient\'s condition based on the following components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Here\'s how I can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient\'s chest pain is described as non-exertional, reproducible, and musculoskeletal in nature, which is less concerning for acute coronary syndrome. This would likely score 0 (low risk).\n2. **ECG**: The ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment deviations or T-wave inversions, which would score 0 (normal).\n3. **Age**: The patient is 57 years old, which is less than 65, so this would score 0.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has hypertension and a family history of premature coronary disease (father with MI in mid-50s). This would score 2 (hypertension + family history).\n5. **Troponin**: The initial troponin is within the normal range, which would score 0.\n\nNow, I need to confirm these details from the patient note to ensure accuracy.</thought>\n<action>extract_clinical_values(patient_note="A 57-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with intermittent left anterior chest discomfort that began earlier in the afternoon while unloading groceries. She describes a dull, aching sensation localized to the left parasternal area, non-radiating, with peak intensity of 4/10, lasting approximately 10–15 minutes per episode, and recurring twice before arrival. The discomfort is exacerbated when she twists her torso or lifts her left arm and is reproducible when she presses over the affected area. She notes no clear exertional component; in fact, a brief walk from the parking lot to triage did not worsen the pain. She denies associated diaphoresis, presyncope or syncope, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or new shortness of breath. She did not take any medications prior to coming in and did not receive any interventions en route. Past medical history is notable for long-standing elevated blood pressure managed by her primary care provider. She also reports a remote episode three years ago of abrupt-onset right arm numbness and transient slurred speech that resolved within an hour; brain MRI at that time showed no acute infarct, and carotid duplex did not reveal hemodynamically significant stenosis or plaque. She has had no recurrences and has no residual neurologic deficits. She has never had a heart attack, coronary stent or bypass surgery, prior stroke, or a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease, and has not been told she has narrowing of her leg arteries or carotids. She maintains that she has never used cigarettes or smokeless tobacco and does not vape. Family history is significant for a first-degree relative with myocardial infarction at an early age; her father required a stent in his mid-50s. She follows regularly with her primary care physician, remains physically active with brisk walking most days, and has been counseled previously on diet and exercise. A lipid panel obtained during a routine visit several months ago was reported to her as within the normal range, and she has not been prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy. She has a medium build; on presentation she is 168 cm tall and weighs 64 kg, with no central adiposity on exam. Home medications include a daily antihypertensive taken in the morning; she is not on hormone therapy or decongestants. She has no known drug allergies. On arrival she appears comfortable and in no acute distress. Vital signs: temperature 36.8°C, blood pressure 148/86 mmHg in the right arm while seated, pulse 76 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Cardiac exam reveals normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or crackles. The chest wall is tender to palpation over the left second and third costochondral junctions, reproducing her described pain; no crepitus or deformity is appreciated. No jugular venous distention or peripheral edema is present. Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Abdomen is soft and non-tender without bruits. Neurologic exam shows an alert, oriented patient with intact cranial nerves, normal strength and sensation in all extremities, and a normal gait. A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained at presentation shows normal sinus rhythm at 74 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals, and no ST-segment deviation, T-wave inversion, or pathologic Q waves; there are no new conduction abnormalities. Initial laboratory testing prior to any ED-administered medications includes a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I that is within the institutional reference range, basic metabolic panel without acute derangements, and a complete blood count not suggestive of anemia or leukocytosis. Chest radiograph obtained at triage demonstrates normal cardiac silhouette and clear lung fields without focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Overall, the character, location, and reproducibility of the discomfort, absence of exertional features, and a benign initial electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarker profile make the symptoms more consistent with a musculoskeletal source than an ischemic etiology, although an evaluation is warranted given her age, elevated blood pressure history, and a family member with premature coronary disease. She remains hemodynamically stable without hypoxia, and serial examinations show no progression of symptoms. She has not exhibited features such as tearing back pain, neurologic deficits, calf swelling, fever, cough, or pleuritic chest pain.
