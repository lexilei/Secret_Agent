THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of first admission. The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, immobilization, recent surgery or trauma, previous PE/DVT, hemoptysis, and malignancy. However, the patient note does not provide explicit information on these specific criteria. Since the required parameters for Wells' criteria are not extractable from the given note, I cannot compute the score.</thought>\n<answer>N/A</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:08:46.339316'}
