The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, respiratory rate, history of PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely. From the previous extraction, I have the heart rate (75), respiratory rate (18), and O2 saturation (98). However, I still need information about DVT, history of PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy, which were not explicitly mentioned in the note. Since these are missing, I will assume they are not present unless stated otherwise. Additionally, the patient's chest pain and nausea/vomiting suggest an alternative diagnosis (esophageal necrosis) is more likely, which would not score points for Wells' criteria. Given this, the patient's Wells' score would be low.</thought>\n<answer>0.00</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:09:08.967469'}
