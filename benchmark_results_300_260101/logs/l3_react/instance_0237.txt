THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the Wells' criteria scoring system. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The features and their corresponding scores are:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): +1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: +1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: +1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: +1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen: +1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): +1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg): +1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose): +1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT: -2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information:\n- The patient has recent plaster immobilization (long-leg cast until five days ago): +1 point\n- The patient has calf swelling >3 cm (43 cm vs 38 cm, a difference of 5 cm): +1 point\n- The patient has pitting edema confined to the affected leg: +1 point\n- There is no mention of active cancer, paralysis, recent bedridden status, localized tenderness along deep veins, entire leg swollen, collateral superficial veins, or an alternative diagnosis as likely as DVT.\n\nThus, the total Wells' score is the sum of the points: 1 (plaster immobilization) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) + 1 (pitting edema) = 3 points.\n\nSince the Wells' criteria does not require any additional calculations or tools, we can directly compute the score based on the extracted clinical features.</thought>\n<answer>3.00</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:21.861339'}
