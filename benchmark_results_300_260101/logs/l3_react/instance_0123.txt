Arterial blood gases analysis on 5 litres of O2 per min showed mixed acidaemia. Serum biochemistry revealed raised urea (15.1 mmol/L) and creatinine (114 umol/L) levels consistent with acute kidney injury, positive D-dimmer\'s levels and increased CRP (48.2 mg/L). Chest radiography showed a loss of volume in the right lung (Figure ) and an electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 94 bpm, left axis deviation and an old inferior myocardial infarction.

From the previous steps, I have the heart rate (94 bpm), but other criteria like clinical signs of DVT, immobilization, recent surgery, previous DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE are missing. Since the patient note does not explicitly mention these criteria, I will assume they are absent unless stated otherwise. The patient does not have clinical signs of DVT, no recent surgery, no previous DVT/PE, no hemoptysis, no malignancy, and the alternative diagnosis (community-acquired pneumonia) was considered initially, making PE less likely. The heart rate is 94 bpm, which is less than 100 bpm, so it does not contribute to the score.
