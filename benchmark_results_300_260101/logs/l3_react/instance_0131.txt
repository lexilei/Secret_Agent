THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to extract relevant clinical values from the patient note. The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), heart rate, recent surgery or immobilization, previous DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), hemoptysis, and malignancy. From the patient note, I can identify the following relevant information:\n\n1. The patient has stage IV colon cancer (malignancy, which is a major risk factor).\n2. The patient's heart rate is 101/minute (tachycardia, which is a minor risk factor).\n3. There is no mention of clinical signs of DVT, recent surgery or immobilization, previous DVT or PE, or hemoptysis in the note.\n\nGiven this, I can assign points based on the Wells' criteria:\n- Malignancy (active treatment): +1 point\n- Heart rate > 100/minute: +1.5 points\n- No other criteria are met based on the note.\n\nTotal score: 2.5 points.\n\nSince the Wells' criteria score is already calculated based on the extracted information, I can directly provide the final answer.</thought>\n<answer>2.5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:07:08.471750'}
