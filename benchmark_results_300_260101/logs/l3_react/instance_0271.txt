THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient presented with chest pain, which is slightly concerning but not highly suspicious. This would likely score 1 point.\n2. **ECG**: The ECG showed sinus tachycardia but no other abnormalities. This would likely score 1 point (non-specific repolarization abnormality).\n3. **Age**: The patient is 60 years old, which is less than 65, so this would score 0 points.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which are 3 risk factors. This would score 2 points (since ≥3 risk factors = 2 points).\n5. **Troponin**: The patient's troponin-T was normal, so this would score 0 points.\n\nAdding these up: 1 (History) + 1 (ECG) + 0 (Age) + 2 (Risk factors) + 0 (Troponin) = 4 points.\n\nSince the HEART Score is a sum of these components, the final score is 4.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:47.464147'}
