THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes the following points:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - Not present in this patient.\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - Not present.\n3. Recently bedridden for more than 3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - The patient had surgery 5 weeks ago, which is outside the 4-week window.\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - The patient has diffuse tightness but no focal tenderness.\n5. Entire leg swollen - Present (right lower extremity from mid-thigh to dorsum of the foot).\n6. Calf swelling at least 3 cm larger than asymptomatic side - Present (mid-femoral circumference difference is 4 cm, and tibial circumference difference is 1.5 cm).\n7. Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg - Present (3-mm indentation on the right leg).\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - Not present.\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT - Not present (no compelling musculoskeletal, infectious, or inflammatory explanation).\n\nEach of these criteria is assigned a point value, and the total score is calculated by summing the points. Based on the patient's status:\n- Entire leg swollen: +1\n- Calf swelling >3 cm: +1\n- Pitting edema: +1\n- No alternative diagnosis: +1\n\nTotal score: 4 points.\n\nSince the task is to calculate the Wells' criteria score for DVT, the final score is 4.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:42.161940'}
