THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information for Wells\' criteria:\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - Not mentioned, so score = 0.\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - Not mentioned, so score = 0.\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - The patient underwent surgery 6 weeks ago, which is outside the 4-week window, so score = 0.\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - The patient notes a generalized sense of pressure but no focal tenderness, so score = 0.\n5. Entire leg swollen - The patient has uniform swelling of the entire right leg, so score = +1.\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to asymptomatic leg - The patient has a 4 cm difference in calf circumference, so score = +1.\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - No pitting edema is mentioned, so score = 0.\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - Not mentioned, so score = 0.\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT - The note states "absence of an alternative explanation that would better account for her presentation," so score = 0.\n\nAdding up the scores: 0 (cancer) + 0 (paralysis) + 0 (bedridden/surgery) + 0 (tenderness) + 1 (entire leg swollen) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) + 0 (pitting edema) + 0 (collateral veins) + 0 (alternative diagnosis) = Total score = 2.\n\nThe Wells\' criteria score for this patient is 2.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:40:44.423825'}
