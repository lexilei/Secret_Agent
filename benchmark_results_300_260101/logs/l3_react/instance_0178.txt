THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the patient\'s ideal body weight (IBW), I need to use the Ideal Body Weight formula. The formula requires the patient\'s sex and height in centimeters. From the patient note, the patient is a 13-year-old female, and her height at presentation was 156 cm. The note also mentions her weight, but IBW is calculated based on height and sex, not actual weight. Therefore, I will extract the height and sex from the note and use the IBW formula for females.</thought>\n\n<action>compute_calculation(calculator_name="Ideal Body Weight", values={"sex": "female", "height_cm": 156})</action>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:23:33.696155'}

THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>The patient's ideal body weight has already been calculated using the Ideal Body Weight formula, which requires the patient's sex and height. The result from the calculation is 48.76 kg.
