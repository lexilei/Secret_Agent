THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient's medical values and health status based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria for DVT include the following points:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) → +1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities → +1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks → +1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system → +1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen → +1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) → +1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) → +1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) → +1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT → -2 points\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The patient has active cancer (stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma, currently undergoing chemotherapy) → +1 point\n- No paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization → 0 points\n- No recent bedridden status or major surgery → 0 points\n- No mention of localized tenderness along the deep venous system → 0 points\n- The swelling is localized to the calf, not the entire leg → 0 points\n- Calf swelling >3 cm (left calf 44 cm vs. right calf 39 cm) → +1 point\n- Pitting edema present on the left calf → +1 point\n- No collateral superficial veins mentioned → 0 points\n- No alternative diagnosis mentioned as likely or greater than DVT → 0 points (no -2 points)\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (active cancer) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) + 1 (pitting edema) = 3 points.\n\nThe Wells' criteria score is 3.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:42:00.561196'}
