{'content': '<thought>To calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for the patient, I need to identify the relevant parameters from the patient note. The CHA2DS2-VASc Score requires the patient\'s age, sex, and optional parameters such as history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, stroke/TIA, vascular disease, diabetes, and whether the patient is female. \n\nFrom the patient note:\n- Age: 68 years\n- Sex: Male (mentioned as "man")\n- Hypertension: Present (mentioned in medical history)\n- Stroke/TIA: Present (left hemiparesis from 2 hours previously, NIHSS score 12, MRI showing right corona radiate infarction, MRA showing right MCA occlusion)\n- Vascular disease: Not explicitly mentioned, but the patient has hypertension and a history of heavy smoking, which are risk factors for vascular disease. However, since it\'s not explicitly stated, we might not count it.\n- Diabetes: Not mentioned\n- CHF: Not mentioned\n- Female: No (patient is male)\n\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc Score is calculated as follows:\n- Age ≥75: 0 (patient is 68)\n- Age 65-74: +1 (patient is 68)\n- Sex (female): +0 (patient is male)\n- CHF: +0 (not mentioned)\n- Hypertension: +1 (present)\n- Stroke/TIA: +2 (present)\n- Vascular disease: +0 (not explicitly mentioned)\n- Diabetes: +0 (not mentioned)\n\nTotal score: 1 (age 65-74) + 1 (hypertension) + 2 (stroke/TIA) = 4.\n\nNow, I will verify this by extracting the required values and computing the score using the compute_calculation tool.</thought>\n\n<action>extract_clinical_values(patient_note="A 68-year-old man with the left hemiparesis from 2 h previously visited the emergency room.

Prothrombin time (16 s; normal 11.5–14.5 s), activated partial thromboplastin time (40.1 s; normal 27.5–41 s), D-dimer (<0.5 mg/mL; normal <0.5 mg/mL), arterial blood gas (room air; pH 7.35), PaO2 (89.0 mmHg), and PaCO2 (45.1 mmHg) were also analyzed.
