He had been taking linagliptin and metformin for the past 10 years due to diabetes mellitus. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) had been conducted 6 months prior to the current presentation as part of a periodic check-up, and it had not depicted any abnormal findings. He had developed abdominal discomfort 1 month prior to the current admission, and 2 weeks after its initial onset he developed abdominal distension that was so severe that he could not eat. He then visited the hospital for testing. There was no tenderness upon abdominal palpation but distension was severe, with fluid wave and shifting dullness indicating ascites. Complete blood count results were as follows, with normal ranges in parentheses: white blood cells 2.1 × 103/μL (4.0–10.0 103/μL), hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL (12–16 g/dL), platelets 318 × 103/μL (150–400 103/μL).
