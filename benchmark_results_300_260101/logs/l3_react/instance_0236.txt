THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific point value. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information for Wells\' criteria:\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): No (0 points)\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: No (0 points)\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: No (0 points)\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: Yes (1 point) - The patient has focal tenderness deep to the medial gastrocnemius.\n5. Entire leg swollen: No (0 points) - Swelling is confined to the mid-calf region.\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg: Yes (1 point) - The right calf measures 41 cm vs. 37 cm on the left, a 4 cm disparity.\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg): Yes (1 point) - The right calf has pitting edema.\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): No (0 points)\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT: No (0 points) - The note suggests DVT is more likely than musculoskeletal strain or ruptured popliteal cyst.\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (tenderness) + 1 (calf swelling >3 cm) + 1 (pitting edema) = 3 points.\n\nThe Wells\' criteria score for this patient is 3, which places them in the "moderate probability" category for DVT.</thought>\n<answer>3.00</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:13.864772'}
