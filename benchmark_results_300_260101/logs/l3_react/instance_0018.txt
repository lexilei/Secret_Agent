Since the patient\'s BMI is within the normal range (18.5-24.9), the adjusted body weight should be the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual weight. The patient\'s actual weight is 58.5 kg, and the ideal body weight is 59.689 kg. Therefore, the adjusted body weight is 58.5 kg. Now, I can proceed to calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation with the extracted values: age=60, sex=\'male\', weight_kg=58.5, creatinine_mg_dl=10.7.</thought>\n<action>compute_calculation(calculator_name="Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", values={"age": 60, "sex": "male", "weight_kg": 58.5, "creatinine_mg_dl": 10.7})</action>', 'raw_action_text': '<action>compute_calculation(calculator_name="Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", values={"age": 60, "sex": "male", "weight_kg": 58.5, "creatinine_mg_dl": 10.7})</action>'}
