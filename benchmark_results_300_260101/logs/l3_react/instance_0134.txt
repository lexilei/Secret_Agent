THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission. The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), heart rate, immobilization, recent surgery or trauma, previous DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), hemoptysis, and malignancy. However, the patient note does not provide explicit information on all these factors. The patient has symptoms like fever, dysuria, oliguria, abdominal pain, cough, and dyspnea, but these are not directly part of the Wells' criteria. Given the lack of specific information required for the Wells' criteria (e.g., signs of DVT, hemoptysis, etc.), it is not possible to accurately calculate the Wells' score based on the provided note. Therefore, the score cannot be determined from the given data.</thought>\n<answer>N/A</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:07:36.945302'}
