His past medical history was notable for hypertension that was well controlled on lisinopril. He was also prescribed with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate 2 years ago due to low testosterone.

He had normal heart sounds without any murmurs and rubs and had clear lungs. He had trace pedal edema bilaterally without any calf tenderness. Laboratory results include leukocytes of 15.4 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 15.8 g/dL, platelets of 207 × 109/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and troponin I <0.05 ng/ml initially, but later plateaued at 0.10 ng/ml.

THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to evaluate the patient's clinical presentation based on the following criteria:\n1. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT (e.g., calf swelling, tenderness) - The patient has trace pedal edema bilaterally without calf tenderness, so this is not present.\n2. Heart rate > 100 bpm - The patient's heart rate is 134 bpm, so this is present.\n3. Hemoptysis - The patient denied hemoptysis, so this is not present.\n4. Immobilization or recent surgery - The patient denied recent surgery, and there is no mention of immobilization, so this is not present.\n5. History of DVT or PE - The patient denied any family history of blood clots, but the note mentions acute DVT in the right lower extremity, which is a current diagnosis, not a prior history. However, the Wells' criteria typically refer to prior history, so this is not present.\n6. Malignancy - The patient was recommended for age-appropriate screening for malignancy, but no active malignancy is mentioned, so this is not present.\n7. Alternative diagnosis less likely than PE - Given the patient's presentation (shortness of breath, chest discomfort, S1Q3T3 pattern on ECG, and CTA-confirmed PE), PE is highly likely, so this is present.\n\nBased on this, the Wells' score would be:\n- Heart rate > 100 bpm: +1.5\n- PE is the most likely diagnosis: +3.0\nTotal score: 4.5</thought>\n<answer>4.5</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:06:01.796441'}
