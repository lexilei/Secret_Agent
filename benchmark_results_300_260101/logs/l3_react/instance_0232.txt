THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nThe Wells\' criteria for DVT includes the following:\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) - 1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities - 1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks - 1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system - 1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen - 1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity) - 1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg) - 1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) - 1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT - subtract 2 points\n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant information:\n1. The patient has metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is on active treatment (bi-weekly gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel regimen) - this qualifies for "Active cancer" - 1 point.\n2. The patient has residual 3+/5 motor strength in the left hip flexors and knee extensors due to an incomplete L4 spinal cord infarction - this qualifies for "Paresis" - 1 point.\n3. The patient is not recently bedridden or had major surgery - 0 points.\n4. There is no mention of localized tenderness along the deep venous system - 0 points.\n5. The entire left leg is swollen - 1 point.\n6. The calf swelling discrepancy is 2 cm (40 cm on the left vs 38 cm on the right), which is less than 3 cm - 0 points.\n7. There is no appreciable pitting edema - 0 points.\n8. No engorged superficial venous channels are visible - 0 points.\n9. The patient has an alternative diagnosis (chronic paresis and spinal cord injury) but the suspicion for DVT is high due to the unilateral swelling and active malignancy, so it\'s unclear if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT. For this case, we will assume the alternative diagnosis is not as likely - 0 points (no subtraction).\n\nAdding up the points: 1 (active cancer) + 1 (paresis) + 1 (entire leg swollen) = 3 points.\n\nThus, the Wells\' criteria score for DVT is 3.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:42:31.960851'}
