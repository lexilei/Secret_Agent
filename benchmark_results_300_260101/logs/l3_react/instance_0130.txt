{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the criteria. The Wells' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, hemoptysis, history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. From the previous extraction, I have the pulse rate (96/min), but other required values like history of DVT or PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy were not mentioned in the patient note. Since these values are missing, I will assume they are negative (not present) unless stated otherwise. The patient does not have dyspnea, chest pain, or pedal edema, and the clinical examination does not suggest signs of DVT. The patient's history of frequent episodes of cough with expectoration and bronchiectasis suggests an alternative diagnosis (COPD) is more likely than PE. Based on this, the Wells' criteria score would be low.</thought>\n<answer>1.00</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:07:01.197051'}
