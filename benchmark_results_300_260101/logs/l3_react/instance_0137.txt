THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To determine the patient\'s Wells\' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient\'s clinical features based on the Wells\' criteria scoring system. The Wells\' criteria include factors such as clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), heart rate, immobilization, recent surgery or trauma, previous DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE), hemoptysis, and malignancy. However, the patient note does not provide explicit information about some of these factors (e.g., clinical signs of DVT, hemoptysis, malignancy). \n\nGiven the available information:\n1. The patient has a heart rate of 77 beats/min (not >100, so no points).\n2. There is no mention of recent surgery or immobilization (no points).\n3. No history of DVT or PE is mentioned (no points).\n4. No hemoptysis is mentioned (no points).\n5. No malignancy is mentioned (no points).\n6. The patient has bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, which could suggest DVT, but this is not explicitly confirmed (uncertain if this qualifies for "clinical signs of DVT").\n7. The patient has exertional dyspnea, which is a symptom but not a specific criterion for Wells\' score.\n\nSince the Wells\' criteria cannot be fully scored due to missing information, the most likely score based on the available data is 0. However, if the bilateral lower extremity pitting edema is considered as clinical signs of DVT, the score would be 3 (major criterion). But this is speculative. Given the lack of clear evidence for most criteria, the score is likely 0.</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:08:36.010732'}
