{'content': '<thought>The repeated failures to compute the GFR using the CKD-EPI equation suggest that the calculator name might not be correctly specified. Upon reviewing the available calculators, I notice that the exact name is "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate". However, the calculation is still failing, possibly due to an issue with the tool. Since I have all the required parameters (age: 17, sex: male, creatinine_mg_dl: 3.7), I will manually compute the GFR using the CKD-EPI formula for males:</thought>\n\n<thought>For males, the CKD-EPI formula is: GFR = 141 * min(SCr/κ, 1)^α * max(SCr/κ, 1)^-1.209 * 0.993^Age * 1.018 [if female]. For males, κ = 0.9 and α = -0.411. Plugging in the values: SCr = 3.7, κ = 0.9, Age = 17.</thought>\n\n<thought>First, compute SCr/κ = 3.7 / 0.9 ≈ 4.111. Since 4.111 > 1, min(SCr/κ, 1) = 1 and max(SCr/κ, 1) = 4.111. Then, GFR = 141 * (1)^-0.411 * (4.111)^-1.209 * 0.993^17. Calculating step-by-step: (4.111)^-1.209 ≈ 0.183, 0.993^17 ≈ 0.895. Thus, GFR ≈ 141 * 1 * 0.183 * 0.895 ≈ 23.1 mL/min/1.73 m².</thought>\n\n<answer>23.1</answer>', 'step_number': 11, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T21:48:10.582726'}
