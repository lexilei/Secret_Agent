THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>Based on the extracted values, I can now calculate the Wells' criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism. The Wells' criteria assigns points as follows:\n- Clinical signs of DVT (swelling, pain, tenderness): +3 points\n- Recent trauma (hard fall and bruising): +1 point\n- Heart rate > 100/min: +1.5 points (but the patient's heart rate is 98/min, so this does not apply)\n- Immobilization: Not mentioned (0 points)\n- Previous DVT/PE: Not mentioned (0 points)\n- Hemoptysis: Not mentioned (0 points)\n- Malignancy: Not mentioned (0 points)\n\nThe total score is the sum of the applicable points: 3 (clinical signs of DVT) + 1 (recent trauma) = 4 points.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:07:27.590877'}
