THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's clinical presentation and history based on the Wells' criteria scoring system. The criteria include factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, hemoptysis, history of DVT/PE, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. From the previous extraction, I have the heart rate (76/min), respiratory rate (12/min), and pulse oximetry (87%). However, I still need information on history of DVT/PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy, which were not explicitly mentioned in the patient note. Since these are missing, I will assume they are not present unless stated otherwise. Additionally, the patient has symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, with rales on auscultation, which may suggest an alternative diagnosis (e.g., COPD exacerbation) is more likely than PE. Based on this, the Wells' score would be low. However, since the Wells' criteria is not one of the available calculators, I will need to manually compute the score based on the extracted and assumed values.</thought>\n<answer>1.00</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:05:35.617161'}
