The conversion factor is 1 mmol/L = 4 mg/dL. \n\nGiven:\n- Serum calcium = 2.26 mmol/L → 2.26 * 4 = 9.04 mg/dL\n- Albumin = 28 g/L → 2.8 g/dL (since 1 g/L = 0.1 g/dL)\n- Normal albumin = 4 g/dL (as specified in the task)\n\nNow, apply the formula:\nCorrected Calcium = 9.04 + 0.8 * (4 - 2.8) = 9.04 + 0.8 * 1.2 = 9.04 + 0.96 = 10.00 mg/dL.</thought>\n<answer>10.00</answer>', 'step_number': 2, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:02:34.728089'}
