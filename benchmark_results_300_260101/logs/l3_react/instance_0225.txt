THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the Wells' criteria scoring system. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. The total score helps determine the probability of DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, we can extract the following relevant features for Wells' criteria:\n1. Active cancer (patient denies any history of malignancy) → Score: 0\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities (patient has not required a cast, brace, or splint) → Score: 0\n3. Recently bedridden for more than 3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks (patient was largely supine for the first four postoperative days and has been mostly in bed since returning home after hemicolectomy 9 days ago) → Score: 1\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system (gentle palpation over the right femoral triangle, popliteal fossa, posterior calf, and along the course of the peroneal veins elicits no focal tenderness) → Score: 0\n5. Entire leg swollen (right lower calf and ankle demonstrate 1+ pitting edema, not the entire leg) → Score: 0\n6. Calf swelling at least 3 cm larger than asymptomatic side (tape-measure circumference at 10 cm below the tibial tuberosity shows a difference of 1.2 cm, which is less than 3 cm) → Score: 0\n7. Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg (right lower calf and ankle demonstrate 1+ pitting edema that is not present on the left side) → Score: 1\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) (no engorged superficial channels over either calf or thigh) → Score: 0\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT (no alternative explanation appears as compelling, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest a competing diagnosis of equal probability) → Score: 0\n\nSumming up the scores: 0 (cancer) + 0 (paralysis) + 1 (bedridden/surgery) + 0 (tenderness) + 0 (entire leg swollen) + 0 (calf swelling ≥3 cm) + 1 (pitting edema) + 0 (collateral veins) + 0 (alternative diagnosis) = Total Wells' score: 2.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:41:21.668687'}
