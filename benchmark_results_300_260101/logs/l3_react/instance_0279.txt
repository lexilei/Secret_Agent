THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Each component is scored from 0 to 2, and the total score ranges from 0 to 10. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a highly suspicious history (chest pain with radiation, diaphoresis, nausea, and persistence despite rest). This is scored as 2.\n2. **ECG**: The ECG shows significant repolarization abnormalities (ST depressions in V4-V6 and inferior leads). This is scored as 2.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 58 years old, which is ≥45 but <65. This is scored as 1.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a prior stent placement (a major risk factor). This is scored as 2.\n5. **Troponin**: The initial troponin I level is 176 ng/L (elevated above the reference range of ≤18 ng/L). This is scored as 1.\n\nAdding these up: 2 (History) + 2 (ECG) + 1 (Age) + 2 (Risk factors) + 1 (Troponin) = 8.</thought>\n<answer>8</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:48:08.871077'}
