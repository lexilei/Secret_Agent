THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's medical values and health status at the time of admission. However, the patient note does not explicitly mention any symptoms or risk factors related to Pulmonary Embolism (e.g., tachycardia, hemoptysis, recent surgery, or immobilization). The patient was asymptomatic and admitted for a mediastinal mass and type B dissection, which are not directly related to Pulmonary Embolism. Since the Wells' criteria are not applicable or calculable based on the provided information, the score would default to 0 (low probability).</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:08:40.917555'}
