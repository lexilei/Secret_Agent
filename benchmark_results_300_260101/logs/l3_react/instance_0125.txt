THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's clinical features based on the criteria. The Wells' criteria include clinical signs and symptoms such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate > 100, immobilization, previous DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and alternative diagnosis less likely than PE. From the patient note, I can extract the following relevant information:\n\n1. Heart rate > 100: The patient's heart rate was 130 bpm (tachycardic), so this is present (+1.5).\n2. Immobilization: No mention of recent immobilization or surgery (0).\n3. Previous DVT/PE: No history mentioned (0).\n4. Hemoptysis: Not mentioned (0).\n5. Malignancy: No active malignancy mentioned (0).\n6. Clinical signs of DVT: No mention of leg swelling or pain (0).\n7. Alternative diagnosis less likely than PE: The patient had fever, cough, and other symptoms that could be due to infection or other causes, so this is likely not present (0).\n\nAdding these up: 1.5 (tachycardia) + 0 (other criteria) = 1.5.</thought>\n<answer>1.5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:05:18.599320'}
