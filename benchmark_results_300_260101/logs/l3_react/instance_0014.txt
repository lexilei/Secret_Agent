{'content': '<thought>To calculate the patient\'s Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, we need the following parameters: age, sex, weight_kg, and creatinine_mg_dl. The patient\'s height is also required to determine if we need to use adjusted body weight based on BMI. \n\nFirst, we need to extract the following values from the patient note:\n- Age: 81 years (from "81-year-old woman")\n- Sex: Female (from "woman")\n- Weight: 40 kg (from "weight was 40 kg")\n- Height: 153 cm (from "height was 153 cm")\n- Serum creatinine: 1.27 mg/dL (from "serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL")\n\nNext, we need to calculate the patient\'s BMI to determine if we should use adjusted body weight. The BMI calculation requires weight and height, which we have. \n\nAfter calculating BMI, we will determine if the patient is underweight, normal, or overweight/obese. Based on that, we will decide whether to use actual weight, ideal body weight, or adjusted body weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.\n\nFinally, we will compute the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation with the appropriate weight.</thought>\n\n<action>extract_clinical_values(patient_note="In April 2011, an 81-year-old woman with a history of photosensitivity and hypertension was admitted to our hospital due to bilateral edema of the legs and nephrotic proteinuria (7.0 g/day).

At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day. Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.\nLaboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL. She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL). Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies. Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL). Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field. Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01. Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.\nBefore renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count. Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL. Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment. The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q.
