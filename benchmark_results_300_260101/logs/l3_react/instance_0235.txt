THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), we need to assess the patient's medical values and health status based on the criteria. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific score. Here's how the patient's information maps to the criteria:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): No mention of cancer in the patient's history. Score = 0.\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: No mention of paralysis or immobilization. Score = 0.\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: The patient had a cesarean section 6 weeks ago, which is more than 4 weeks. Score = 0.\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: The patient has focal tenderness along the popliteal vein and posteromedial calf. Score = 1.\n5. Entire leg swollen: The patient has swelling confined to the left calf, not the entire leg. Score = 0.\n6. Calf swelling at least 3 cm larger than asymptomatic side (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): The patient has a 1.6 cm difference (38.0 cm vs. 36.4 cm), which is less than 3 cm. Score = 0.\n7. Pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg: The patient has pitting edema on the left calf. Score = 1.\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): No mention of collateral superficial veins. Score = 0.\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT: The patient's symptoms strongly suggest DVT, and no alternative diagnosis is mentioned. Score = -2 (since DVT is the leading consideration).\n\nAdding up the scores: 0 (cancer) + 0 (paralysis) + 0 (bedridden/surgery) + 1 (tenderness) + 0 (entire leg swollen) + 0 (calf swelling ≥3 cm) + 1 (pitting edema) + 0 (collateral veins) - 2 (alternative diagnosis) = 0.\n\nHowever, the Wells' criteria also includes a subjective assessment of whether an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT. In this case, the note states that DVT is the leading consideration, so we assign -2 for this criterion. The total score is 0.</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:43:05.234349'}
