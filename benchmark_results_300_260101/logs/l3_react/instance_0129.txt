THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism, I need to assess the patient's clinical presentation based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria includes factors such as clinical signs of DVT, heart rate, immobilization, history of DVT/PE, hemoptysis, malignancy, and whether PE is the most likely diagnosis. From the patient note, the patient is asymptomatic with normal vital signs (heart rate 67 bpm, respiratory rate 19 bpm, oxygen saturation 99%, blood pressure 144/83 mmHg), no signs of DVT, no hemoptysis, no history of DVT/PE mentioned, and no indication of malignancy. The patient is also not immobilized. Based on this, the patient scores 0 on the Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism.</thought>\n<answer>0</answer>", 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:06:38.089338'}
