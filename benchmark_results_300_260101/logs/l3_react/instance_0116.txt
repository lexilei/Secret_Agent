She had been treated for bronchial asthma with a bronchodilator and leukotriene antagonist for 2 years but had no medical history related to hematologic malignancy. The patient\'s hemogram results at admission were as follows: white blood cell count, 0.95×109/L; hemoglobin level, 8.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 105.9 fL; and platelet count, 29.0×109/L. The patient\'s biochemical test results at admission were as follows: serum protein level, 6.8 g/dL; serum albumin level, 2.8 g/dL; serum creatinine level, 1.54 mg/dL; serum calcium level, 7.4 mg/dL; and serum lactate dehydrogenase level, 719 IU/L. In the examination of a peripheral blood smear, pancytopenia with rouleaux formation was observed. Bone marrow aspirates showed hypocellular marrow without an increase in the number of myeloblasts but showed increased infiltration of plasma cells at a frequency of 14.9% (). In addition, megakaryocytic dysplasias such as separated nuclei () and hypolobulated nuclei () were found, accounting for 30% of the total number of megakaryocytes. Erythroid dysplasias such as binucleation and delayed mitosis were also found (), as well as mild granulocytic dysplasias such as hyposegmentation, accounting for 15% and 10% of the total numbers of erythroid and granulocytic lineage cells, respectively.

The subsequently performed serum electrophoresis using Capillarys Protein(E) 6 kit (Sebia, France) showed the presence of monoclonal gammopathy accompanied by M-peaks of 1.27 g/dL. All radiological evaluation results did not show definite evidence of osteolytic lesion. The results of a subsequently performed karyotype analysis showed 46,XX, del(20)(q11.2)[15]/46,XX[5], indicating the presence of del(20)(q11.2) clone, at a frequency of 75%.
