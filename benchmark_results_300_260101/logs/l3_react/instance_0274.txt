THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin. Here's how we can assess each component based on the patient note:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with multiple PCIs and presents with chest pain consistent with prior angina. This is highly suspicious for acute coronary syndrome, which would score 2 points.\n2. **ECG**: The ECG shows sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block and lateral t-wave inversions, which are nonspecific but concerning changes. This would score 1 point.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 64 years old, which is less than 65, so this would score 0 points.\n4. **Risk Factors**: The patient has multiple risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. This would score 2 points.\n5. **Troponin**: The troponin level is normal (0.02 ng/mL), which would score 0 points.\n\nNow, we can sum these points to get the HEART Score.</thought>\n<answer>5</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:47:26.014687'}
