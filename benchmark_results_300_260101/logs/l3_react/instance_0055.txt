On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 °C of body temperature.

The patient presented with dyspnea, lower extremity edema and some wounds over bilateral ankles area for 1 day before admission, but had no other symptoms, including a headache, sore throat, cough, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. He had alcohol and chronic hepatitis C- related liver cirrhosis, and took diuretics in the past 5 years. He drank approximately 60 g of alcohol per day for more than 20 years, but recently had been taking a bit more than usual. His laboratory data 2 weeks before admission were 6.5 mg/ dl of total bilirubin, 2.1 g/dl of albumin, and 1.73 of international normalized ratio. In addition, he had moderate ascites, which was medically controlled. These findings were indicative of Child- Pugh class C liver cirrhosis. On arrival, he appeared to be in disturbance and distress that was classified as 13 (E3V4M6) on the Glasgow Coma Scale. His vital signs were 132/106 mmHg of blood pressure, 125 beats/minute of pulse rate, 24 breaths/minute of respiratory rate, and 38.4 °C of body temperature. Auscultation of the lung and heart revealed coarse breath sounds and rapid irregular heartbeats. His abdomen was soft and swollen. Two wounds with redness and swelling (measures 0.5 × 0.5 cm, left ankle; measures 1 × 1 cm, right ankle) were found on his lower extremities ( and ). Chest X-ray indicated a lower lobe infiltration and a mild blunting of C-P angle in the right side (). ECG showed atrial fibrillation. Laboratory findings also included 8,990/ml of white blood cell count with 94% neutrophils and 3% lymphocytes, 11.1 g/dl of hemoglobin level, 104,000/ml of platelet count, 23 mg/dl of blood urea nitrogen, 1.42 mg/dl of creatinine, 121 mmol/L of sodium, and 4.6 mmol/L of potassium. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrated 152 cells/mm3 of ascitic white blood cell count and 30 cells/mm3 of polymorphonuclear cell count 10 hours later after his arrival of emergency department. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a severe metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.38, pCO2: 20.4 mmHg, pO2: 91.8 mmHg; base deficit: 11.2 mmol/L), which was indicative of septic shock.
