THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. The HEART Score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher risk. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has crescendo angina with NYHA class IV symptoms, which is highly suspicious (2 points).\n2. **EKG**: The patient's EKG shows inferior Q waves and left ventricular hypertrophy without acute ST-T abnormalities, which is nonspecific but not normal (1 point).\n3. **Age**: The patient is 66 years old, which is ≥65 years (1 point).\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and a history of ischemic stroke (multiple risk factors, 2 points).\n5. **Troponin**: The patient's troponin T was <0.03 ng/mL, which is normal (0 points).\n\nAdding these up: 2 (History) + 1 (EKG) + 1 (Age) + 2 (Risk factors) + 0 (Troponin) = 6.</thought>\n<answer>6</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:19.249525'}
