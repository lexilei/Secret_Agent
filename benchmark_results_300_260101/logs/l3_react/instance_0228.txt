THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To determine the patient's Wells' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to evaluate the patient's medical values and health status based on the Wells' criteria components. The Wells' criteria for DVT includes several clinical features, each assigned a specific point value. The components relevant to this patient are:\n\n1. Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): 1 point\n2. Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities: 1 point\n3. Recently bedridden for >3 days or major surgery within 12 weeks requiring general or regional anesthesia: 1 point\n4. Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system: 1 point\n5. Entire leg swollen: 1 point\n6. Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): 1 point\n7. Pitting edema (greater in the symptomatic leg): 1 point\n8. Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose): 1 point\n9. Alternative diagnosis as likely or greater than that of DVT: -2 points\n\nFrom the patient note:\n- The patient underwent major surgery (open reduction and internal fixation of a displaced left clavicular fracture) under general anesthesia within the past 12 weeks: +1 point.\n- The patient has localized tenderness along the deep venous pathway (posterior tibial and popliteal veins): +1 point.\n- The patient has calf swelling >3 cm (4 cm difference) compared to the asymptomatic leg: +1 point.\n- There is no mention of active cancer, paralysis, recent plaster immobilization, entire leg swelling, pitting edema, or collateral superficial veins: 0 points for these.\n- The patient's symptoms strongly favor DVT over alternative diagnoses (no clinical findings to suggest cellulitis, musculoskeletal injury, ruptured Baker cyst, etc.): 0 points for alternative diagnosis (not -2).\n\nAdding these up: 1 (surgery) + 1 (tenderness) + 1 (calf swelling) = 3 points.</thought>\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:41:51.774035'}
