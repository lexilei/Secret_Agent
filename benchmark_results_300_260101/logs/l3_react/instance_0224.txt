THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To determine the patient\'s Wells\' criteria score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to extract specific clinical values from the patient note that correspond to the criteria. The Wells\' criteria for DVT includes several factors such as active cancer, paralysis or recent immobilization, recent bed rest or surgery, localized tenderness, swelling of the entire leg, calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg, pitting edema, collateral superficial veins, and an alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT. \n\nFrom the patient note, I can identify the following relevant information:\n1. The patient has swelling of the entire left leg (from groin to ankle).\n2. There is a 4.2 cm increase in maximal calf circumference on the left compared to the right (asymmetry >3 cm).\n3. There is moderate pitting edema along the anterior tibial surface extending from the dorsum of the foot up to the proximal thigh.\n4. There are visible dilated superficial collateral veins over the medial thigh and calf.\n5. The patient denies recent trauma, overuse injury, or infection, and there is no alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT mentioned.\n6. The patient has no history of immobilization, recent surgery, or active cancer.\n\nBased on this, the patient meets several criteria for Wells\' score:\n- Swelling of the entire leg (+1)\n- Calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg (+1)\n- Pitting edema (+1)\n- Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) (+1)\n- No alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than DVT (+3)\n\nThe total score would be the sum of these points.</thought>\n<action>compute_calculation(calculator_name="Wells\' criteria for DVT", values={"swelling_entire_leg": True, "calf_swelling_gt_3cm": True, "pitting_edema": True, "collateral_veins": True, "alternative_diagnosis": False})</action>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:41:04.205799'}

THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To calculate the Wells\' criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), I need to extract specific clinical values from the patient note that correspond to the criteria. The Wells\' criteria include several factors such as swelling of the entire leg, calf swelling >3 cm compared to the asymptomatic leg, pitting edema, collateral superficial veins, and whether an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT. From the patient note, I can identify the following:\n\n1. Swelling of the entire leg: The patient reports the entire limb, from groin to ankle, feeling "tight" with a heavy sensation.\n2. Calf swelling >3 cm: Measurement in triage showed a 4.2 cm increase in maximal calf circumference on the left compared with the contralateral leg.\n3. Pitting edema: Moderate pitting edema is elicited along the anterior tibial surface and extends from the dorsum of the foot up to the proximal thigh.\n4. Collateral superficial veins: Physical examination reveals visible dilation of superficial, non-varicose collateral veins tracking over the medial thigh and calf.\n5. Alternative diagnosis: The note states that alternative explanations such as musculoskeletal strain, lymphatic insufficiency, heart failure, or infection appear less plausible.\n\nSince the compute_calculation tool does not directly support Wells\' criteria, I will manually calculate the score based on the extracted values. Each of the above factors (1-4) contributes +1 point, and the absence of an equally plausible alternative diagnosis (5) contributes +1 point. The total score is the sum of these points.</thought>\n<answer>5.00</answer>', 'step_number': 1, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:41:09.780443'}
