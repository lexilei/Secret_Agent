THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on the following components: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. However, the available calculators do not include the HEART Score directly. Therefore, we need to manually assess each component based on the patient's medical values and health status when first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.</thought>\n\n<thought>1. History: The patient presented with exertional chest pain, which is highly suspicious for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This would score 2 points.\n2. ECG: Electrocardiography did not show any ischemic changes, which scores 0 points.\n3. Age: The patient is 62 years old, which is less than 65, scoring 0 points.\n4. Risk factors: The patient has hypertension as the only risk factor for heart disease, scoring 1 point.\n5. Troponin: The patient note does not mention troponin levels, so we assume it is normal (0 points).</thought>\n\n<thought>Summing up the points: History (2) + ECG (0) + Age (0) + Risk factors (1) + Troponin (0) = 3 points.</thought>\n\n<answer>3</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:31.036176'}
