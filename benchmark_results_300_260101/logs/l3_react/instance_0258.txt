THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) for Pre-Operative Risk, we need to assess the patient's risk factors based on the following criteria:\n1. High-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular procedures)\n2. History of ischemic heart disease\n3. History of congestive heart failure\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease\n5. Preoperative treatment with insulin\n6. Preoperative serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n\nFrom the patient note:\n1. The patient is scheduled for an open pancreaticoduodenectomy, which is a high-risk surgery (intraperitoneal).\n2. There is no history of ischemic heart disease, heart attack, or coronary stents.\n3. No history of congestive heart failure.\n4. No history of stroke, transient neurologic events, or carotid surgery.\n5. The patient is on insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n6. The preoperative serum creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL, which is not >2.0 mg/dL.\n\nThus, the patient has two risk factors: high-risk surgery and preoperative insulin use. The RCRI score is the sum of these risk factors.</thought>\n<answer>2</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:45:34.813302'}
