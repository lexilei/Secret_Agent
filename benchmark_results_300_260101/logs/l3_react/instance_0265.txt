THOUGHT:
{'content': "<thought>To calculate the HEART Score, we need to evaluate the patient's condition based on five components: History, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. Each component is scored from 0 to 2, and the total score ranges from 0 to 10. Here's how we can assess each component based on the patient's initial admission information:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has a 1-hour history of sudden-onset chest pain without significant cardiovascular risk factors. This is moderately suspicious, so we assign a score of 1.\n2. **ECG**: The ECG revealed no clear findings of ischemic ST-T changes or prior Q-wave myocardial infarction. This is non-specific, so we assign a score of 1.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 49 years old, which is less than 65. We assign a score of 0.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has no significant cardiovascular risk factors mentioned. We assign a score of 0.\n5. **Troponin**: The troponin T level is elevated at 0.855 ng/mL, which is significantly above the normal range. We assign a score of 2.\n\nAdding these scores together: 1 (History) + 1 (ECG) + 0 (Age) + 0 (Risk factors) + 2 (Troponin) = 4.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>", 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:12.564527'}
