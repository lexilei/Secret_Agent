THOUGHT:
{'content': '<thought>To determine the patient\'s HEART Score, I need to evaluate the following components: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. The patient note provides information on some of these components, but not all. Here\'s how I can break it down:\n\n1. **History**: The patient has episodic pressing/burning anterior chest pain that radiates to the back, accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, and mild dyspnea. This is highly suspicious for cardiac pain, which would score 2 points in the HEART Score.\n2. **EKG**: The note mentions "nonspecific changes," which would score 1 point in the HEART Score.\n3. **Age**: The patient is 58 years old, which is less than 65, so this would score 0 points.\n4. **Risk factors**: The patient has hypertension and obesity but denies smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or family history of heart disease. Hypertension is a risk factor, so this would score 1 point.\n5. **Troponin**: The note does not mention troponin levels, so I cannot assign a score for this component. However, since the task specifies using the patient\'s status at admission prior to any treatment, I will assume troponin was not measured yet and score this as 0 points.\n\nAdding these up: History (2) + EKG (1) + Age (0) + Risk factors (1) + Troponin (0) = Total HEART Score of 4.</thought>\n<answer>4</answer>', 'step_number': 0, 'timestamp': '2026-01-01T22:46:26.171887'}
