Patient Note:
A 58-year-old woman came to the pre-operative medicine clinic this afternoon for assessment before a scheduled open pancreaticoduodenectomy planned in four days for a 2.8-cm peri-ampullary mass that was discovered on surveillance imaging for hereditary pancreatitis; the operation will be performed through an upper midline incision with anticipated operative time of 6–8 hours and possible need for portal vein reconstruction. She reports intermittent epigastric discomfort, early satiety, and a 6-pound unintentional weight loss over the past three months but denies any change in exercise tolerance, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle swelling, or exertional chest tightness. Walking her two dogs for a mile each morning and climbing three flights of apartment stairs carrying groceries do not provoke shortness of breath or pressure across the sternum. She has long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 36 and currently administers 24 units of insulin glargine each night with supplemental lispro based on pre-meal capillary readings; the most recent self-monitor log brought to clinic shows fasting glucose between 95 and 145 mg/dL. Oral metformin 500 mg twice daily and empagliflozin were discontinued last week at the surgeon’s request, but she continues liraglutide 0.6 mg subcutaneously each morning for weight control. Hypertension treated with losartan 50 mg and amlodipine 5 mg daily, mild persistent asthma for which she uses a budesonide-formoterol inhaler twice daily, and gastroesophageal reflux managed with pantoprazole complete her active problem list. She has never been told she had a heart attack, underwent stress testing, or received any coronary stents, and she has no history of stroke, transient neurologic events, carotid surgery, or carotid bruit on previous examinations. Obstetric history is remote and uncomplicated. She quit cigarette smoking 12 years ago after accumulating a 15-pack-year exposure and now drinks red wine only on weekends, usually two glasses. There is a family history of pancreatic malignancy in a brother at 52 and insulin-requiring diabetes in a mother who died in her 80s; no premature coronary disease or cerebrovascular accidents are reported in first-degree relatives. Current vital signs obtained after five minutes seated rest are blood pressure 128/70 mm Hg in the right arm, pulse 68 beats per minute and regular, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, afebrile at 36.7 °C, oxygen saturation 98% breathing ambient air, and body mass index 29 kg/m². On examination she is alert, comfortable, and speaking full sentences. Neck veins are not distended at 45°; carotid upstrokes are brisk and without bruit. Cardiac auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2, no extra sounds, and no murmurs. The point of maximal impulse is nondisplaced, and peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally with intact capillary refill. Lung fields are clear to percussion and auscultation without wheezes or crackles, and there is no dullness or egophony. The abdomen is soft with mild tenderness in the epigastrium but no guarding, rebound, or ascites; the liver edge is palpable 1 cm below the costal margin, and a faint midline scar from a prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy is noted. No hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal bruits are present. There is no ankle edema, calf tenderness, or skin discoloration. Neurologic screening finds cranial nerves II–XII intact, symmetrical strength 5/5 in all extremities, normal sensation to light touch, and a steady tandem gait. Pre-operative laboratory results drawn immediately before the visit show hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL, hematocrit 38%, white blood cell count 7.4 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 230 × 10⁹/L, sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, consistent with measurements over the prior year; estimated glomerular filtration rate is 82 mL/min/1.73 m². Aspartate aminotransferase is 34 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 29 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 3.9 g/dL, fasting glucose 118 mg/dL, and HbA1c measured last month was 7.0%. A baseline electrocardiogram performed today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 66 beats per minute, normal intervals, and no ST-T wave abnormalities. Chest radiograph shows clear lung fields and a normal mediastinal silhouette. The anesthesia service has evaluated her airway as Mallampati class II with a thyromental distance of 6.5 cm and full neck extension. She has been counseled to continue her nighttime basal insulin at a 75% dose the evening before surgery, with morning rapid-acting doses omitted and intra-operative glucose managed on protocol. Antihypertensive therapy will be continued except for the angiotensin receptor blocker, which she will hold on the morning of the procedure. Pulmonary function has been optimized with strict adherence to controller inhaler therapy and daily incentive spirometry practice. After a comprehensive discussion covering surgical details, potential risks—including bleeding, pancreatic leak, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia, and cardiovascular complications—post-operative disposition to the surgical intensive care unit for at least 24 hours, and expected recovery timeline, the patient expressed understanding and agreement to proceed; written informed consent has been documented.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
