Patient Note:
A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with rapid onset of severe pain and swelling in his right great toe overnight. He reports experiencing a similar episode several years ago but cannot recall the diagnosis or the medication he was given for treatment. His medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, poorly controlled diabetes, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 101 mEq/L
K+: 5.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 259 mg/dL
Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

The interphalangeal joint of the right great toe is aspirated, with the synovial fluid aspirate shown under polarized light microscopy in Figure A.

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
