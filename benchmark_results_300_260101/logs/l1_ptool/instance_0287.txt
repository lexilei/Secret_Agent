Patient Note:
A 55-year-old woman regularly visited our hospital as an outpatient because of hepatitis B occult infection. A liver tumor was point out by CT. CT revealed a protruding liver tumor located at segment 8 3 cm in size, which include cystic lesion (Fig. ). US and MRI reveal the same feature (Fig. ). There was no distant metastasis. The patient had no past or family history including gynecological illness. 18F-FDG PET revealed the accumulation of 18F-FDG, and maximum standard uptake value was 2.3. Laboratory results included a white blood cell count of 3200/μL and platelet count of 189,000/μL. Prothrombin time international normalized ratio was 1.02. Total serum bilirubin was 0.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.03 mg/dL, albumin 4.5 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 17 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 187 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 49 U/L. Tumor markers such as CEA, CA19-9, AFP, and DCP were normal. HBs-antigen and HBc-antibody were positive, and HBs-antibody and HCV-antibody were negative. The Child–Pugh score was 5, grade A. She was diagnosed as intrahepatic cystadenocarcinoma and received extended posterior segmentectomy including diaphragm. Macroscopic findings revealed the tumor buried to the liver with the intracystic hemorrhage (Fig. ). The protruded comportment was closely touched to the diaphragm. Microscopic findings revealed the tumor and hemorrhage within the cyst (Fig. ). Tumor was located between the liver and diaphragm.
Histopathological evaluation revealed intracystic clear cell adenocarcinoma. The tumor has ductal structure including mucin and atypical nuclear with clear cytoplasm (Fig. ). The tumor was separated from the liver and the diaphragm (Fig. ). There is no traffic with the bile duct and ovarian stroma. PAS staining was positive. There was lack of ovarian clear cell carcinoma’s features such as hobnail appearance. The expression of Pax8 (Fig. ) was positive, but the expression CK7 and HNF1β(Fig. ) was positive and that of CD10 and ER was negative, which indicate that the tumor has the feature of clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, not renal cell carcinoma nor cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was discharged 13 days after surgery with no complication. According to the microscopic findings, gynecological interview and examinations after hepatic resection were performed, but there were no sign of menstrual irregularity and genital bleeding, and no endometriosis.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
