Patient Note:
A 62-year-old man was admitted due to reduced appetite and abdominal distension, which he had reportedly been experiencing for the last month.
The patient had been followed up regularly since undergoing a liver transplant 15 years prior due to fulminant hepatic failure associated with hepatitis B, and he had been taking tacrolimus 2 mg regularly since that transplant. He had been taking linagliptin and metformin for the past 10 years due to diabetes mellitus. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) had been conducted 6 months prior to the current presentation as part of a periodic check-up, and it had not depicted any abnormal findings. He had developed abdominal discomfort 1 month prior to the current admission, and 2 weeks after its initial onset he developed abdominal distension that was so severe that he could not eat. He then visited the hospital for testing.
There was no tenderness upon abdominal palpation but distension was severe, with fluid wave and shifting dullness indicating ascites.
Complete blood count results were as follows, with normal ranges in parentheses: white blood cells 2.1 × 103/μL (4.0–10.0 103/μL), hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL (12–16 g/dL), platelets 318 × 103/μL (150–400 103/μL). Blood biochemistry results were total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (0.2–1.1 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase 21 U/L (5–40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 9 U/L (5–40 U/L), albumin 3.7 g/dL (3.5–5.2 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen 14.4 mg/dL (8.0–20.0 mg/dL), creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (0.5–1.3 mg/dL), C-reactive protein 10.8 mg/dL (0.0–0.5 mg/dL). Among the tumor markers tested for, carcinoembryonic antigen was normal (1.3 ng/mL; normal range 0.0–5.0 ng/mL) but lactate dehydrogenase was elevated (746 U/L; normal range 200–450 U/L).
Abdominopelvic CT depicted diffuse peritoneal thickening, omental masses and nodules, and ascites with omental fat infiltration, but no mass-like lesions or bowel obstruction were evident in the gastrointestinal tract (Figure ). A primary peritoneal disease such as tuberculous peritonitis or malignant mesothelioma was suspected. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was performed, and it did not depict abnormal hypermetabolism in solid organs, lymph nodes, or digestive organs but it did reveal diffuse hypermetabolism in the peritoneum and omentum (Figure ).

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
