Patient Note:
A 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and liver failure secondary to hepatitis C, with status post liver transplant 13 years priorly, was brought in by ambulance to the emergency department for acutely altered mental status. The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he “felt sick.” The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.
Upon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4°F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.
Physical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.
Fingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 μmol/L (reference range, 15–55 μmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.
Owing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.
During the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 μmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 μmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus. The patient did not immediately improve neurologically during the hospitalization stay and was ultimately transferred to another facility for continued treatment and rehabilitation.

Question: What is the patient's score of the Fibrosis 4 Index? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
