Patient Note:
A 51-year-old woman from South America with a past medical history of anemia, hypertension, kidney stones, and COVID-19, 4 months prior (a positive antigen test without symptoms) was evaluated in the emergency department after being found to have calcium of 15.7 mg/dL in clinic. The patient endorsed fatigue, night sweats, lightheadedness, nausea, right flank pain with radiation to the right lower quadrant, urinary frequency, diffuse bone pain, constipation for the past 1 month, and weight loss of about 15 lb over the past 6 months. The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or dysuria. Physical exam was benign except for severe tenderness to palpation over the buttocks and hips.
Laboratories on admission were significant for calcium 15.9 mg/dL (reference range: 8.6-10.2 mg/dL), creatinine 1.33 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.20 mg/dL), 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D 116.0 pg/mL (reference range: 19.9-79.3), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D 21.0 ng/mL (reference range: >30 ng/mL). Parathyroid hormone was low (15.3 pg/mL, reference range: 15.0-65.0), and alkaline phosphatase was within normal limits. Of note, ACE was found to be elevated to 139 U/L (reference range: 14-82 U/L).
The patient was hydrated and treated with calcitonin, decreasing her calcium to 11.3 mg/dL and her creatinine to 0.98 mg/dL. On further interviewing of this patient (admission Day 4), it was discovered that she had silicone injections in her buttocks approximately 23 years ago by a local doctor. Her calcium continued to be >11 mg/dL despite in vitro fertilization (IVF) and calcitonin. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of malignancy; however, it was significant for extensive bilateral granulomatous calcifications of the patient’s buttocks. The patient was started on steroid treatment with prednisone 60 mg daily. Ultimately, she was discharged after 5 days (once her calcium decreased to 10.6 mg/dL) and was given a 2-week course of prednisone; on return to clinic 3 weeks later (1 week after completion of her steroid taper), her calcium remained at 10.9 mg/dL. Four months later, this patient’s calcium was found to be only mildly elevated to 10.6 mg/dL ().

Question: Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
