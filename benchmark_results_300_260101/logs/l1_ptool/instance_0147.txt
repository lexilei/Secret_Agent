Patient Note:
A 78-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and surgical resection of HCC was followed up for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetes. The patient’s medical history included hepatic steatosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and ESRD. He had been prescribed metformin, pantoprazole, enalapril, felodipine, metoprolol. The patient was a non-smoker and non-drinker. At the age of 74 years, the patient was introduced to our hospital for HCC surgery (). His physical examination on admission was unremarkable. Liver enzymes and function tests, namely bilirubin (0.44 mg/dL), albumin (4.0 mg/dL), and International Normalized Ratio (1.06) were within the normal range, while creatinine was slightly elevated at 1.74 mg/dL. The patient underwent right lobectomy of the liver for HCC, and dialysis was initiated after surgery. At 5 months after the hepatic resection, computed tomography and chest radiography revealed multiple tumors in the lung, indicating metastatic disease (). At that time, serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) was abnormally elevated (648 mAU/mL). The serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was 5.7 ng/mL. The patient did not receive any anticancer therapy because of his ESRD and the advanced stage of HCC. We subsequently followed up on his natural course with serial imaging. Chest radiography revealed an increase in the size and number of lung metastases, and tumor markers were significantly elevated 4 months after recurrence (AFP, 1198 ng/mL; PIVKA-II, 214155 mAU/mL). However, 13 months after recurrence, the metastatic lesions suddenly decreased in size and number without receiving any specific treatment or herbal medicine (). Follow-up imaging showed no evidence of disease progression, and tumor makers were significantly decreased (AFP, <1.0 ng/mL; PIVKA-II, 46 mAU/mL) (). There were no signs of new lesions on imaging or an increase in tumor markers over 41 months after the recurrence.

Question: Using the MDRD GFR Equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²? If the patient is black, please use the MDRD GFR Equation for Blacks. You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
