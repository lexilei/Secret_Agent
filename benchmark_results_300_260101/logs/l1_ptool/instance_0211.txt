Patient Note:
A 62-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis visited outpatient clinic for unexplained weight loss. He had a good performance status (grade 0). Laboratory tests showed serum albumin level of 5.3 g/dL, bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio of 1.1. Neither ascites nor hepatic encephalopathy was found, which corresponded with Child-Pugh class A. Serologic markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. Serum α-fetoprotein level was 311.7 ng/mL, and PIVKA-II level was over 2,000 mAU/mL. Other laboratory findings including tumor markers and thyroid function tests were within normal limits. About a 5 cm sized ovoid enhancing mass in arterial phase involving the caudate lobe with underlying cirrhotic configuration of the liver was shown on the dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (, respectively). There was no vascular invasion and no intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. On positron emission tomography-CT, maximum standardized uptake value for the mass was 6.3 without evidence of distant metastasis. Overall, early stage of HCC was assigned according to the Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer (BCLC) HCC staging system.
Surgical resection was recommended for the treatment of the HCC, however, he refused the surgical treatment. TACE using DEB was performed after obtaining written informed consent for the procedure. During the first TACE session, hepatic angiogram revealed a definite hypervascular mass supplied by a small branch of the left hepatic artery without apparent arteriovenous shunt (). After positioning the microcatheter tip at the left hepatic artery close to the tumor-feeding branch, a mixture of DEB (DC Bead®, 1 vial of 300~500 µm diameter, Biocompatibles, UK) loaded with doxorubicin (50 mg) and contrast agent was infused until the flow through the tumor-feeding artery was slowed down. After the infusion, angiogram showed occluded tumor-feeding branch and no tumor staining ().
He had no serious adverse event after embolization except mild abdominal pain that was controlled with oral analgesic (tramadol 50 mg per os tid). One-month post-embolization CT () and six-month post-embolization MRI () showed complete necrosis without viable portions. Follow-up α-fetoprotein level was 3.89 ng/mL, and PIVKA-II level was 21 mAU/mL. This patient remains in good health without cancer recurrence 6 months after the procedure.

Question: What is the patient's Child-Pugh Score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.
