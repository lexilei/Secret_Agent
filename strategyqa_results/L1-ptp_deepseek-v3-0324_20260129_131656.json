Scott Fitzgerald, approximately 50,000 words.  \n- \"The Raven\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, only about 1,000 words.  \n- A typical speed reader might read at 500-1000 words per minute (or even faster for some).  \n\nStep 3: Compare and reason  \n- Even a slow speed reader (500 wpm) would take about 100 minutes (less than 2 hours) to read \"The Great Gatsby\".  \n- \"The Raven\" is only 1,000 words - even a non-speed reader could read it in a few minutes.  \n- Therefore, \"The Raven\" can be read much faster than \"The Great Gatsby\", regardless of reading speed.\n\nStep 4: Determine answer  \n- The speed reader will finish \"The Raven\" first because it is significantly shorter.  \n- So, they will NOT devour \"The Great Gatsby\" before \"The Raven\" (they will read \"The Raven\" first).\n\nAnswer: False\n\n```python\ndef answer_yes_no(question: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Answer a yes/no question by identifying key facts and reasoning.\n\n    >>> answer_yes_no(\"Will speed reader devour The Great Gatsby before the Raven?\")\n    # Step 1: Identify what we need to know\n    key_facts_needed = [\"length of The Great Gatsby\", \"length of The Raven\", \"typical speed reading rate\"]\n    # Step 2: Recall relevant facts\n    fact_1 = \"The Great Gatsby is ~50,000 words long\"\n    fact_2 = \"The Raven is ~1,000 words long\"\n    fact_3 = \"Speed readers can read 500-1000 words per minute\"\n    # Step 3: Compare and reason\n    comparison = \"Even at 500 wpm, Gatsby takes ~100 min, Raven takes ~2 min.
