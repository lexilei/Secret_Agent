The solar cycle refers to the approximately 11-year cycle of solar activity (sunspots, solar flares, etc.), which is not what calendar months are based on.\n\nMonths are primarily based on the lunar cycle (Moon phases), not the solar cycle. The traditional concept of months arose from the cycle of Moon phases, with lunar months lasting approximately 29.53 days. While modern calendars like the Gregorian calendar have months that don't perfectly align with lunar cycles, they still have their origins in lunar observations rather than the 11-year solar cycle.\n\nNo",
