Let me search specifically for the relationship between months and celestial cycles.\n  Action: retrieve(month definition lunar cycle solar year calendar)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the sunspot cycle of about 11 (22) years has been proposed, including:\n\n[Chinese calendar]: The traditional Chinese calendar (officially known as the Agricultural Calendar [\u8fb2\u66c6; \u519c\u5386; N\u00f3ngl\u00ec; 'farming calendar'], Former Calendar [\u820a\u66c6; \u65e7\u5386; Ji\u00f9l\u00ec], Traditional Calendar [\u8001\u66c6; \u8001\u5386; L\u01ceol\u00ec] or Lunar Calendar [\u9670\u66c6; \u9634\u5386; Y\u012bnl\u00ec; 'yin calendar']), is a lunisolar calendar which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. In modern days, it is defined in China by GB/T 33661\u20132017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.\n\n[Year]: A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; see below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard ISO 80000-3, Annex C, supports the symbol a (for Latin annus) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations y and yr are commonly used.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not giving me the specific information about whether months are based on the solar cycle. I need to look for a direct definition of a \"month\" in astronomy or calendrical terms. Let me try a more precise search.\n  Action: retrieve(what is a month astronomical basis)\n  Observation: [Easter]: In 725, Bede succinctly wrote, \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[February]: February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of summer (being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere).\n\n[Leap year]: A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (called intercalating in technical terminology) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a common year.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided a clear definition of what a month is based on. I need to specifically look up the astronomical definition of a month to determine its relationship to the solar cycle.\n  Action: lookup(What is the astronomical basis for the definition of a month?)\n  Observation: Based on the context provided, the astronomical basis for a month is the lunar cycle, as a month is defined by the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth. This is reflected in the Paschal full moon being defined as the 14th day of a lunar month.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The lookup action suggests that months are based on the lunar cycle (Moon's orbit around Earth). However, the question is specifically about the solar cycle (Sun-related). I need to confirm this distinction and see if there are any solar-based month definitions. Let me search for different types of months to get a complete picture.\n  Action: retrieve(types of months sidereal month synodic month solar month)\n  Observation: [Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November. April and July. No month corresponds to August. Leap years January, April and July. February and August. March and November. No month corresponds to October. All years September and December. No month corresponds to May or June. In the months table below, corresponding months have the same number, a fact which follows directly from the definition.\n\n[Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\n\n[February]: February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras.

The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[February]: February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of summer (being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere).\n\n[Leap year]: A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (called intercalating in technical terminology) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a common year.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided a clear definition of what a month is based on. I need to specifically look up the astronomical definition of a month to determine its relationship to the solar cycle.\n  Action: lookup(What is the astronomical basis for the definition of a month?)\n  Observation: Based on the context provided, the astronomical basis for a month is the lunar cycle, as a month is defined by the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth. This is reflected in the Paschal full moon being defined as the 14th day of a lunar month.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The lookup action suggests that months are based on the lunar cycle (Moon's orbit around Earth). However, the question is specifically about the solar cycle (Sun-related). I need to confirm this distinction and see if there are any solar-based month definitions. Let me search for different types of months to get a complete picture.\n  Action: retrieve(types of months sidereal month synodic month solar month)\n  Observation: [Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November. April and July. No month corresponds to August. Leap years January, April and July. February and August. March and November. No month corresponds to October. All years September and December. No month corresponds to May or June. In the months table below, corresponding months have the same number, a fact which follows directly from the definition.\n\n[Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\n\n[February]: February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of summer (being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere).\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific information about different types of months. I need to search more precisely for astronomical definitions of months, particularly focusing on lunar vs solar-based months.\n  Action: retrieve(sidereal month synodic month tropical month definition)\n  Observation: [Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\n\n[Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November.

In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of summer (being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere).\nStep 8:\n  Thought: The searches so far haven't provided clear information about different types of months. I need to search specifically for the definition of a \"solar month\" and its relationship to the solar cycle.\n  Action: retrieve(solar month definition astronomical basis)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Play media Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years. Solar maximum and solar minimum refer to periods of maximum and minimum sunspot counts. Cycles span from one minimum to the next.\n\n[Easter]: In 725, Bede succinctly wrote, \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[Solar cycle]: The solar cycle or solar magnetic activity cycle is a nearly periodic 11-year change in the Sun's activity measured in terms of variations in the number of observed sunspots on the solar surface. Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

First, I should understand what the solar cycle is and what defines a month. I'll start by breaking down the question and searching for information about the origin and definition of months.\n  Action: retrieve(origin of months definition solar cycle)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the sunspot cycle of about 11 (22) years has been proposed, including:\n\n[Solar cycle]: The solar cycle or solar magnetic activity cycle is a nearly periodic 11-year change in the Sun's activity measured in terms of variations in the number of observed sunspots on the solar surface.

I need to search specifically for the astronomical basis of the month. I should look for information on how months are defined in relation to celestial cycles.\n  Action: retrieve(month definition lunar solar cycle astronomy)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the sunspot cycle of about 11 (22) years has been proposed, including:\n\n[Astronomy]: Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.\n\n[Observational astronomy]: Observational astronomy is a division of astronomy that is concerned with recording data about the observable universe, in contrast with theoretical astronomy, which is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice and study of observing celestial objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical instruments.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous search didn't yield relevant information about how months are defined. I need to be more specific in my search about the astronomical basis of months.

The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; see below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard ISO 80000-3, Annex C, supports the symbol a (for Latin annus) to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days.

Ignoring the influence of other solar system bodies, Earth's orbit is an ellipse with the Earth-Sun barycenter as one focus and a current eccentricity of 0.0167; since this value is close to zero, the center of the orbit is close, relative to the size of the orbit, to the center of the Sun.\n\n[Exploration of the Moon]: The Cold War-inspired \"space race\" and \"Moon race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States of America accelerated with a focus on the Moon. This included many scientifically important firsts, such as the first photographs of the then-unseen far side of the Moon in 1959 by the Soviet Union, and culminated with the landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969, widely seen around the world as one of the pivotal events of the 20th century, and indeed of human history in general."

For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication.

Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time.

Pig latin is a language game where words are altered by moving the initial consonant cluster to the end and adding \"ay\" (e.g., \"pig\" becomes \"igpay\"). The question is whether pigs (the animals) can use this. Since pigs lack the cognitive and vocal abilities for human language games, I should search for information about pig intelligence and communication.\n  Action: retrieve(pig intelligence communication abilities)\n  Observation: [Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT).

Pig latin is a language game where words are altered by moving the initial consonant cluster to the end and adding \"ay\" (e.g., \"pig\" becomes \"igpay\"). The question is whether pigs (the animals) can use this. Since pigs lack the cognitive and vocal abilities for human language games, I should search for information about pig intelligence and communication.\n  Action: retrieve(pig intelligence communication abilities)\n  Observation: [Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n\n[Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little Pigskins, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin. YouTube). The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all-time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The previous search for \"pig intelligence communication abilities\" did not return relevant results about pigs (the animals). I need to refine my search to specifically target information about the cognitive and linguistic capabilities of pigs, as this is crucial to determine if they can perform a complex language game like Pig Latin.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal intelligence vocalization language abilities)\n  Observation: [Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT).

I need to try a different query to specifically target the cognitive abilities of pigs, as the current results are dominated by the CIA and Pig Latin (the language game). I should search for \"pig animal cognitive abilities\" or similar.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal cognitive abilities communication)\n  Observation: [Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields.

For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not returning information about pig (animal) intelligence or communication. The results are dominated by Pig Latin (the language game) and general human language development. I need to be more specific and avoid the term \"pig latin\" in my query to prevent confusion. I should search for \"pig animal vocalization and intelligence\" to directly target the capabilities of pigs.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocalization intelligence cognitive skills)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world.

Pig latin is a language game where words are altered by moving the initial consonant cluster to the end and adding \"ay\" (e.g., \"pig\" becomes \"igpay\"). The question is whether pigs (the animals) can use this. Since pigs lack the cognitive and vocal abilities for human language games, I should search for information about pig intelligence and communication.\n  Action: retrieve(pig intelligence communication abilities)\n  Observation: [Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n\n[Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little Pigskins, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin. YouTube).

I should search for \"pig animal cognitive abilities\" or similar.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal cognitive abilities communication)\n  Observation: [Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields.

Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not returning information about pig (animal) intelligence or communication. The results are dominated by Pig Latin (the language game) and general human language development. I need to be more specific and avoid the term \"pig latin\" in my query to prevent confusion. I should search for \"pig animal vocalization and intelligence\" to directly target the capabilities of pigs.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocalization intelligence cognitive skills)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world. Soft Skills, communication skills, business writing, corporate presentation, public speaking, sales, marketing, leadership and managerial skills are few of the skills.\n\n[Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT).

To get information about the animal's capabilities, I need a more precise query that avoids these terms. I will search for \"Sus scrofa domesticus communication\" using the scientific name to target the animal specifically.\n  Action: retrieve(Sus scrofa domesticus communication vocalization)\n  Observation: [Pork]: Pork is the culinary name for the meat of a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide, with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication.

For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not returning information about pig (animal) intelligence or communication. The results are dominated by Pig Latin (the language game) and general human language development. I need to be more specific and avoid the term \"pig latin\" in my query to prevent confusion. I should search for \"pig animal vocalization and intelligence\" to directly target the capabilities of pigs.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocalization intelligence cognitive skills)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world.

Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not returning information about pig (animal) intelligence or communication. The results are dominated by Pig Latin (the language game) and general human language development. I need to be more specific and avoid the term \"pig latin\" in my query to prevent confusion. I should search for \"pig animal vocalization and intelligence\" to directly target the capabilities of pigs.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocalization intelligence cognitive skills)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world. Soft Skills, communication skills, business writing, corporate presentation, public speaking, sales, marketing, leadership and managerial skills are few of the skills.\n\n[Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT).

I will search for \"Sus scrofa domesticus communication\" using the scientific name to target the animal specifically.\n  Action: retrieve(Sus scrofa domesticus communication vocalization)\n  Observation: [Pork]: Pork is the culinary name for the meat of a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).

Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered.

Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication. Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches are still not returning information about pig (animal) intelligence or communication. The results are dominated by Pig Latin (the language game) and general human language development. I need to be more specific and avoid the term \"pig latin\" in my query to prevent confusion. I should search for \"pig animal vocalization and intelligence\" to directly target the capabilities of pigs.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocalization intelligence cognitive skills)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world. Soft Skills, communication skills, business writing, corporate presentation, public speaking, sales, marketing, leadership and managerial skills are few of the skills.\n\n[Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT).

To get information about the animal's capabilities, I need a more precise query that avoids these terms. I will search for \"Sus scrofa domesticus communication\" using the scientific name to target the animal specifically.\n  Action: retrieve(Sus scrofa domesticus communication vocalization)\n  Observation: [Pork]: Pork is the culinary name for the meat of a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide, with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication.

I need to try a different approach to find information about pig communication abilities. Perhaps I should search specifically for \"pig animal sound production\" or \"pig vocal capabilities\" to understand their physical ability to produce speech-like sounds.\n  Action: retrieve(pig animal vocal capabilities sound production)\n  Observation: [Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields.

Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Singing]: The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords, but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume (loudness), timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.\n\n[Larynx]: Manipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch. This source sound is altered as it travels through the vocal tract, configured differently based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and pharynx. The process of altering a source sound as it passes through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages as well as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic prosody. The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in creating pressure differences required for sound production; a constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The search for \"pig animal vocal capabilities sound production\" still returned Pig Latin and human vocal anatomy, but did provide some relevant information about sound production in the \"Larynx\" and \"Singing\" entries. However, I still lack specific information about pig vocal capabilities. I need to look up whether pigs have the physical ability to produce the complex sounds required for Pig Latin.\n  Action: lookup(Can pigs produce human speech sounds?)\n  Observation: No, pigs cannot produce human speech sounds. While they have vocal cords, their anatomy lacks the complex vocal tract and articulators like the human tongue and lips necessary to form the specific sounds of human language.\nStep 8:\n  Thought: Based on the lookup result, pigs cannot produce human speech sounds due to anatomical limitations. Since Pig Latin is a manipulation of human language sounds (requiring precise control over consonants and vowels), pigs would be physically incapable of producing these sounds. Now I should confirm this with a final evaluation.\n  Action: evaluate(Pigs lack the vocal anatomy to produce human speech sounds required for Pig Latin)\n  Observation: True\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

It asks if a Dodo would hypothetically tower over Ma Petite. First, I need to know the average height of a Dodo bird and the height of Ma Petite. I should start by decomposing the question to identify the key facts needed.\n  Action: decompose(Would a Dodo hypothetically tower over Ma Petite?)\n  Observation: Here is a breakdown of the question into simpler sub-questions:\n\n1.  What was the average height of a Dodo bird?\n2.  What was the height of Ma Petite?\n3.  Based on these heights, would the Dodo be significantly taller?\nStep 2:\n  Thought: Now I need to retrieve information about the average height of a Dodo bird and the height of Ma Petite. I'll start by searching for facts about the Dodo.\n  Action: retrieve(Dodo bird average height)\n  Observation: [Dodo]: Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) tall and may have weighed 10.6\u201317.5\u00a0kg (23\u201339\u00a0lb) in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. As these vary considerably, and only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem. It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius.\n\n[Emu]: The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the second-largest living bird by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia, but the Tasmanian, Kangaroo Island and King Island subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\n[Standing desk]: While height of most seated desks is standardized, standing desks are made in many different heights ranging from 70 to 128 centimetres (28 to 50\u00a0in). Ideally the height of a standing desk fits the height of its individual user. With seated desks, adjusting the height relative to the user can be accomplished by adjusting the height of the user's chair. However, because users of a standing desk move around more than when seated, using a pedestal to adjust the user's height is not practical.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: I have information about the Dodo's height (about 1 meter or 3 ft 3 in).

In contrast to polar bears, Asian black bears have powerful upper bodies for climbing trees, and relatively weak hind legs which are shorter than those in brown bears and American black bears. They are the most bipedal of all bears, and have been known to walk upright for over a quarter mile. The heel pads on the forefeet are larger than those of most other bear species. Their claws, which are primarily used for climbing and digging, are slightly longer on the fore foot (30\u201345\u00a0mm) than the back (18\u201336\u00a0mm), and are larger and more hooked than those of the American black bear.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.\n\n[Asian black bear]: An Asian black bear with broken hind legs can still climb effectively. In contrast to polar bears, Asian black bears have powerful upper bodies for climbing trees, and relatively weak hind legs which are shorter than those in brown bears and American black bears. They are the most bipedal of all bears, and have been known to walk upright for over a quarter mile. The heel pads on the forefeet are larger than those of most other bear species. Their claws, which are primarily used for climbing and digging, are slightly longer on the fore foot (30\u201345\u00a0mm) than the back (18\u201336\u00a0mm), and are larger and more hooked than those of the American black bear.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I'm still not getting relevant results about youth organizations. Let me try a more specific search for \"Young Bears\" as a scouting or youth group term, as that might yield better results.\n  Action: retrieve(Young Bears\" scouting group)\n  Observation: [Scout (Scouting)]: A Scout (in some countries a Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or Pathfinder) is a child, usually 10\u201318 years of age, participating in the worldwide Scouting movement. Because of the large age and development span, many Scouting associations have split this age group into a junior and a senior section. Scouts are organized into troops averaging 20\u201330 Scouts under the guidance of one or more Scout Leaders. Troops subdivide into patrols of about 6\u20138 Scouts and engage in outdoor and special interest activities. Troops may affiliate with local, national, and international organizations. Some national Scouting associations have special interest programs such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts, outdoor high adventure, Scouting bands, and rider Scouts.\n\n[Scouting]: The Scout movement, also known as Scouting or the Scouts, is a voluntary non-political educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of gender, origin, race or creed, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the founder, Lord Baden-Powell. The purpose of the Scout Movement is to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.\n\n[Bear]: Brown and American black bears are generally diurnal, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night. Other species may be nocturnal, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators. Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs). Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense. With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use olfaction to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognize their cubs.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I'm still not finding specific information about \"Young Bears\" as a youth group. Let me try searching for \"eagles\" in the context of scouting organizations, as some scouting groups use animal names for their age groups or patrols.\n  Action: retrieve(eagles scout group patrol name)\n  Observation: [Boy Scouts of America]: Eagle Scout is the highest rank one can receive in Scouts BSA. A Scout who attains this rank is called an Eagle Scout. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million young men. Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements.\n\n[Golden eagle]: Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho. The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey. A fully-grown golden eagle requires about 230 to 250\u00a0g (8.1 to 8.8\u00a0oz) of food per day but in the life of most eagles there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week and then gorge on up to 900\u00a0g (2.0\u00a0lb) at one sitting.\n\n[Philadelphia Eagles]: The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. In the 2017 season the team won Super Bowl LII, their first Super Bowl win in franchise history and their fourth NFL title overall, after winning the Championship Game in 1948, 1949, and 1960.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: I found that \"Eagle\" is used in scouting as the highest rank (Eagle Scout), but I need to check if \"eagles\" is used as a label for a youth group itself, not just a rank. Also, I still need to find information about \"young bears\" as a youth group label. Let me try a different approach and search for \"young bears\" in the context of youth organizations more broadly.\n  Action: retrieve(young bears\" youth group organization)\n  Observation: [Bear]: Brown and American black bears are generally diurnal, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night.

If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain.

Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The previous retrieve action did not return relevant information about Pikachu's personality or any connection to Charles Darwin. I need to try a more specific search query to find information about Pikachu itself.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Pok\u00e9mon)\n  Observation: [Pok\u00e9mon]: In most incarnations of the Pok\u00e9mon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon is able to capture that Pok\u00e9mon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Pok\u00e9 Ball at it. If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain. Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the sh\u014dgun's palace) still has a gate called Hanz\u014d's Gate (Hanz\u014dmon), and the Hanz\u014dmon subway line which runs from Hanz\u014dmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located.

Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The previous searches have not found any evidence of a connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin. Since Pikachu is a fictional character with no documented opinions on historical figures, and no canonical source links it to Darwin, I can conclude that there is no basis to say Pikachu \"likes\" Charles Darwin. However, I should verify this by checking if there is any mention of Darwin in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise context.\n  Action: lookup(Is Charles Darwin ever mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon media?)\n  Observation: No, based on the provided context, Charles Darwin is not mentioned. The term \"evolution\" in Pok\u00e9mon refers to a sudden metamorphosis of a creature, not the scientific theory proposed by Darwin.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific delivery point\u2014and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point."

The Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1971 moved this holiday to the third Monday, which can fall from February 15 to 21, inclusive.\n\n[Birthday]: A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage.\n\n[Federal holidays in the United States]: New Year's Day Independence Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day George Washington's Birthday became a Federal holiday in 1879. In 1888 and 1894, respectively, Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) and Labor Day were created. In 1938, Armistice Day (now Veterans Day) was created to mark the end of World War I. The scope and the name of the holiday was expanded in 1954 to honor Americans who fought in World War II and the Korean War.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I found that George Washington was unanimously elected and his birthday is a federal holiday.

For phone service, the islands are included in the North American Numbering Plan, using area code 670.\n\n[Federal holidays in the United States]: Some individuals and organizations have objected to the federal status of certain holidays, such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Columbus Day. In particular, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina opposed the creation of the federal holiday for the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1983.\n\n[United States Postal Service]: Mail carriers, also referred to as mailmen or letter carriers, prepare and deliver mail and parcels. They are divided into two categories: City Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NALC, and Rural Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70\u00a0lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday. Rural carriers are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted. Mail handlers and processors, prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks.

A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific delivery point\u2014and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\nStep 9:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided clear information about whether mail is delivered on federal holidays.

It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.

Several other large species can reach over 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) long and weigh over 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) long.

C. suchus was not included because its morphological codings were identical to those of C. niloticus. However, the authors suggested that the lack of differences was due to limited specimen sampling, and considered the two species to be distinct. This analysis found weak support for the clade Osteolaeminae. Brochu named Osteolaeminae in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae, but the group has since been classified within Crocodylinae.

Species of the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just 1.5 to 1.9\u00a0m (4.9 to 6.2\u00a0ft), whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to sizes over 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and weigh 1,000\u00a0kg (2,200\u00a0lb). Several other large species can reach over 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) long and weigh over 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) long. The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.\n\n[Memphis, Tennessee]: Memphis is a city located along the Mississippi River in southwestern Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. The 2018 city population was 650,618, making Memphis the largest city on the Mississippi River, the second most populous city in Tennessee, as well as the 26th largest city in the United States. Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan area in the United States, with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017. The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region, which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas, Mississippi, and the Missouri Bootheel. Memphis is the seat of Shelby County, the most populous county in Tennessee. As one of the more historic and culturally significant cities of the southern United States, the city features a wide variety of landscapes and distinct neighborhoods.\n\n[Saltwater crocodile]: The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is a crocodilian native to saltwater habitats and brackish wetlands from India's east coast across Southeast Asia and the Sundaic region to northern Australia and Micronesia. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It was hunted for its skin throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous for people who share the same environment.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The initial search didn't provide specific information about Saltwater crocodiles in Memphis.

Performers such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Robert Wilkins, Joe McCoy, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie used a variety of unusual instruments such as washboard, fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. Memphis Minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. Pianist Memphis Slim began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided information about Saltwater crocodiles specifically in Memphis zoos or facilities.

In the case of hippos, they usually had a pool of water and patch of grass. In the 1980s, zoo exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. For example, the Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium features a 360,000-US-gallon (1,400,000\u00a0l) pool. In 1987, the Toledo Zoo saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo. The exhibit was so popular, the hippos became the logo of the Toledo Zoo.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't found specific information about saltwater crocodiles at Memphis Zoo.

The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.\n\n[Memphis, Tennessee]: Memphis is a city located along the Mississippi River in southwestern Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. The 2018 city population was 650,618, making Memphis the largest city on the Mississippi River, the second most populous city in Tennessee, as well as the 26th largest city in the United States. Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan area in the United States, with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017. The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region, which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas, Mississippi, and the Missouri Bootheel.

Performers such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Robert Wilkins, Joe McCoy, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie used a variety of unusual instruments such as washboard, fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. Memphis Minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. Pianist Memphis Slim began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements.

In the case of hippos, they usually had a pool of water and patch of grass. In the 1980s, zoo exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. For example, the Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium features a 360,000-US-gallon (1,400,000\u00a0l) pool. In 1987, the Toledo Zoo saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo.

The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.\n\n[Crocodile]: Subfamily Crocodylinae Genus Crocodylus Crocodylus acutus, American crocodile Crocodylus intermedius, Orinoco crocodile Crocodylus johnsoni, freshwater crocodile, or Johnstone's crocodile Crocodylus mindorensis, Philippine crocodile Crocodylus moreletii, Morelet's crocodile or Mexican crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, Nile crocodile or African crocodile (the subspecies found in Madagascar is sometimes called the black crocodile) Crocodylus novaeguineae, New Guinea crocodile Crocodylus palustris, mugger, marsh or Indian crocodile Crocodylus porosus, saltwater crocodile or estuarine crocodile Crocodylus rhombifer, Cuban crocodile Crocodylus siamensis, Siamese crocodile (may be extinct in the wild) Crocodylus suchus, West African crocodile, desert or sacred crocodile Genus Osteolaemus Osteolaemus tetraspis, dwarf crocodile (There has been controversy as to whether or not this is actually two species; recent (2010) DNA analysis indicate three distinct species: O. tetraspis, O. osborni and a third, currently unnamed.) Genus Mecistops Mecistops cataphractus West African slender-snouted crocodile Mecistops leptorhynchus Central African slender-snouted crocodile Genus \u2020Euthecodon Genus \u2020Rimasuchus (formerly Crocodylus lloydi) Genus \u2020Voay Brochu, 2007 (formerly Crocodylus robustus) The cladogram below follows the topology from a 2012 analysis of morphological traits by Christopher A. Brochu and Glenn W. Storrs. Many extinct species of Crocodylus might represent different genera. \"Crocodylus\" pigotti, for example, was placed in the newly erected genus Brochuchus in 2013. C. suchus was not included because its morphological codings were identical to those of C. niloticus. However, the authors suggested that the lack of differences was due to limited specimen sampling, and considered the two species to be distinct. This analysis found weak support for the clade Osteolaeminae. Brochu named Osteolaeminae in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae, but the group has since been classified within Crocodylinae. It includes the living genus Osteolaemus as well as the extinct species Voay robustus and Rimasuchus lloydi.\n\nQuestion: Does Memphis Zoo have saltwater crocodiles?\n\nAnswer:",

I need to search more specifically for the density of the materials used in Euro coins (nickel brass and copper-nickel) or find direct information about whether coins sink or float in water.\n  Action: retrieve(density of nickel brass and copper-nickel alloys)\n  Observation: [Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations. Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific density values I need. The retrieved information mentions nickel and its alloys but doesn't provide density figures. I should try a more direct approach and look up whether Euro coins sink or float specifically, or search for the density of the specific alloys used in Euro coins.\n  Action: retrieve(do Euro coins sink or float density)\n  Observation: [Euro coins]: Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\n\n[Euro]: The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I still need to find the density of the specific alloys used in Euro coins. The previous searches haven't provided the necessary numbers. Let me try a more specific query for the density of Nordic gold (used in 10c, 20c, 50c coins) and the nickel brass/copper-nickel alloys used in \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.\n  Action: retrieve(density of Nordic gold nickel brass copper-nickel)\n  Observation: [Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations.

Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy.

This depends on its density compared to water. I should first search for information about the density of Euro coins and the principle of buoyancy.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin density buoyancy)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.

This depends on its density compared to water. I should first search for information about the density of Euro coins and the principle of buoyancy.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin density buoyancy)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. The coin is used in 22 countries (with 20 legally adopting it) with a collective population of about 341\u00a0million. The coin is made of two alloys: the inner part of nickel brass, the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information doesn't specifically mention the density of Euro coins, though it does mention the materials used (nickel brass and copper-nickel for the 2 euro coin). I need to find the actual density values for these materials and compare them to water's density (1 g/cm\u00b3). Let me search more specifically for Euro coin specifications.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin composition density specifications)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.

I need to search more specifically for the density of the materials used in Euro coins (nickel brass and copper-nickel) or find direct information about whether coins sink or float in water.\n  Action: retrieve(density of nickel brass and copper-nickel alloys)\n  Observation: [Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations. Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific density values I need. The retrieved information mentions nickel and its alloys but doesn't provide density figures. I should try a more direct approach and look up whether Euro coins sink or float specifically, or search for the density of the specific alloys used in Euro coins.\n  Action: retrieve(do Euro coins sink or float density)\n  Observation: [Euro coins]: Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\n\n[Euro]: The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I still need to find the density of the specific alloys used in Euro coins. The previous searches haven't provided the necessary numbers. Let me try a more specific query for the density of Nordic gold (used in 10c, 20c, 50c coins) and the nickel brass/copper-nickel alloys used in \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.\n  Action: retrieve(density of Nordic gold nickel brass copper-nickel)\n  Observation: [Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations.

I should try a more direct approach by looking up whether coins in general or Euro coins specifically sink or float in water, or search for the actual density values of the specific coin alloys.\n  Action: retrieve(do coins sink in water density of coin metals)\n  Observation: [Metal]: A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals including such coinage metals as silver and gold. Most coins today are made of base metals with no intrinsic value, in the past, coins frequently derived their value primarily from their precious metal content.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials.

Let me try a more specific query about the density of the exact alloys used in Euro coins, particularly focusing on Nordic gold (used in 10c, 20c, 50c coins) and the nickel brass/copper-nickel combination used in \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.\n  Action: retrieve(density of Nordic gold alloy composition)\n  Observation: [Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[Nordic Passport Union]: The Nordic Passport Union allows citizens of the Nordic countries\u00a0\u2013 Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland\u00a0\u2013 to travel and reside in another Nordic country (and Svalbard) without any travel documentation (e.g. a passport or national identity card) or a residence permit. Since 25 March 2001, all five states have also been within the Schengen Area. The Faroe Islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union but not the Schengen Area, while Greenland and Svalbard are outside both.\n\n[Nazism and race]: Hitler made references to an \"Aryan Race\" founding a superior type of humanity. The purest stock of Aryans according to Nazi ideology was the Nordic people of Germany, England, The Netherlands and Scandinavia. The Nazis defined Nordics as being identified by tall stature (average 175\u00a0cm), long faces, prominent chins, narrow and straight noses with a low bridge, lean builds, doliocephalic skulls, straight light hair, light eyes, and fair skin. The Nazis claimed that Germanic people specifically represented a southern branch of the Aryan-Nordic population. The Nazis did not consider all Germans to be of the Nordic type (which predominated the north), and stated that Germany also had a large \"Alpine\" population (identified by, among other features, lower stature, stocky builds, flatter noses, and higher incidences of darker hair and eyes). Hitler and Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. G\u00fcnther framed this as an issue to be corrected through selective breeding for \"Nordic\" traits. Hitler Youth propaganda emphasized the \"Nordic\" nature of Germans, with the text issued to all Hitler Youth members stating: \"the principal ingredient of our people is the Nordic race (55%). That is not to say that half our people are pure Nordics. All of the aforementioned races appear in mixtures in all parts of our fatherland. The circumstance, however, that the great part of our people is of Nordic descent justifies us taking a Nordic standpoint when evaluating our character and spirit, bodily structure, and physical beauty.\"\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain the specific density values I need.

Most coins today are made of base metals with no intrinsic value, in the past, coins frequently derived their value primarily from their precious metal content.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).\n\n[Euro coins]: Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.

This depends on its density compared to water. I should first search for information about the density of Euro coins and the principle of buoyancy.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin density buoyancy)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. The coin is used in 22 countries (with 20 legally adopting it) with a collective population of about 341\u00a0million. The coin is made of two alloys: the inner part of nickel brass, the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information doesn't specifically mention the density of Euro coins, though it does mention the materials used (nickel brass and copper-nickel for the 2 euro coin). I need to find the actual density values for these materials and compare them to water's density (1 g/cm\u00b3).

Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature.

Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes.

Their respective densities of 1.7, 2.7 and 4.5\u00a0g/cm3 can be compared to those of the older structural metals, like iron at 7.9 and copper at 8.9\u00a0g/cm3. An iron ball would thus weigh about as much as three aluminium balls."
