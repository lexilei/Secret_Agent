I should search for information on the definition and origin of months.\n  Action: retrieve(origin of months definition)\n  Observation: [New Year's Day]: Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) instituted the concept of celebrating the new year in 2000\u00a0BC and celebrated new year around the time of the vernal equinox, in mid-March. The early Roman calendar designated 1 March as the first day of the year. The calendar had just 10 months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through to December, the ninth through to the twelfth months of the Gregorian calendar, were originally positioned as the seventh through to the tenth months. (Septem is Latin for \"seven\"; octo, \"eight\"; novem, \"nine\"; and decem, \"ten\".) Roman legend usually credited their second king Numa with the establishment of the two new months of Ianuarius and Februarius. These were first placed at the end of the year, but at some point came to be considered the first two months instead.\n\n[Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November. April and July. No month corresponds to August. Leap years January, April and July. February and August. March and November. No month corresponds to October. All years September and December. No month corresponds to May or June. In the months table below, corresponding months have the same number, a fact which follows directly from the definition.\n\n[English words of Greek origin]: The Greek language has contributed to the English vocabulary in five main ways:\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The previous search didn't provide information about the astronomical basis of months. I need to specifically search for how months are defined in relation to astronomical cycles (lunar vs solar).\n  Action: retrieve(month definition lunar solar cycle)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the sunspot cycle of about 11 (22) years has been proposed, including:\n\n[Solar cycle]: The solar cycle or solar magnetic activity cycle is a nearly periodic 11-year change in the Sun's activity measured in terms of variations in the number of observed sunspots on the solar surface. Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n\n[Solar cycle]: Play media Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years. Solar maximum and solar minimum refer to periods of maximum and minimum sunspot counts. Cycles span from one minimum to the next.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided clear information about the astronomical basis of months. I need to specifically search for how months are defined in calendars, particularly whether they are based on the lunar cycle or the solar cycle.\n  Action: retrieve(calendar months lunar solar basis)\n  Observation: [Chinese calendar]: The traditional Chinese calendar (officially known as the Agricultural Calendar [\u8fb2\u66c6; \u519c\u5386; N\u00f3ngl\u00ec; 'farming calendar'], Former Calendar [\u820a\u66c6; \u65e7\u5386; Ji\u00f9l\u00ec], Traditional Calendar [\u8001\u66c6; \u8001\u5386; L\u01ceol\u00ec] or Lunar Calendar [\u9670\u66c6; \u9634\u5386; Y\u012bnl\u00ec; 'yin calendar']), is a lunisolar calendar which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. In modern days, it is defined in China by GB/T 33661\u20132017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.\n\n[Julian calendar]: Although most Eastern Orthodox countries (most of them in eastern or southeastern Europe) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a synod in Constantinople in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated Easter astronomically at Jerusalem. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with the exception of the Finnish Orthodox Church, which uses the Gregorian Paschalion.\n\n[July 2009 lunar eclipse]: An annular solar eclipse on January 26. A penumbral lunar eclipse on February 9. A penumbral lunar eclipse on July 7. A total solar eclipse on July 22. A penumbral lunar eclipse on August 6. A partial lunar eclipse on December 31. This eclipse is one of five lunar eclipses in a short-lived series. The lunar year series repeats after 12 lunations or 354 days (Shifting back about 10 days in sequential years). Because of the date shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't clearly addressed whether months are based on the solar cycle.

Because of the date shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events.\n\n[Easter]: In 725, Bede succinctly wrote, \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[August 2008 lunar eclipse]: A partial lunar eclipse took place on August 16, 2008, the second of two lunar eclipses in 2008, with the first being a total eclipse on February 20, 2008. The next lunar eclipse was a penumbral eclipse occurring on February 9, 2009, while the next total lunar eclipse occurred on December 21, 2010.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I still haven't found a clear explanation of whether months are based on the solar cycle.

Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23\u00a0mi) in diameter. Hurricane John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting 31\u00a0days in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961, however, many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations. John is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record, with a path of 8,250\u00a0mi (13,280\u00a0km). Cyclone Rewa of the 1993\u201394 South Pacific and Australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere, traveling a distance of over 5,545\u00a0mi (8,920\u00a0km) during December 1993 and January 1994.\n\n[Climate of Hawaii]: Hawaii differs from many tropical locations with pronounced wet and dry seasons, in that the wet season coincides with the winter months (rather than the summer months more typical of other places in the tropics). For instance, Honolulu's K\u00f6ppen climate classification is the rare As wet-winter subcategory of the Tropical wet and dry climate type.\n\n[Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific information I need about the astronomical basis of months.

I should search for information on the definition and origin of months.\n  Action: retrieve(origin of months definition)\n  Observation: [New Year's Day]: Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) instituted the concept of celebrating the new year in 2000\u00a0BC and celebrated new year around the time of the vernal equinox, in mid-March. The early Roman calendar designated 1 March as the first day of the year. The calendar had just 10 months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through to December, the ninth through to the twelfth months of the Gregorian calendar, were originally positioned as the seventh through to the tenth months. (Septem is Latin for \"seven\"; octo, \"eight\"; novem, \"nine\"; and decem, \"ten\".)

Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n\n[Solar cycle]: Play media Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years. Solar maximum and solar minimum refer to periods of maximum and minimum sunspot counts. Cycles span from one minimum to the next.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't provided clear information about the astronomical basis of months.

In modern days, it is defined in China by GB/T 33661\u20132017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.\n\n[Julian calendar]: Although most Eastern Orthodox countries (most of them in eastern or southeastern Europe) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a synod in Constantinople in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated Easter astronomically at Jerusalem. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with the exception of the Finnish Orthodox Church, which uses the Gregorian Paschalion.\n\n[July 2009 lunar eclipse]: An annular solar eclipse on January 26.

Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23\u00a0mi) in diameter. Hurricane John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting 31\u00a0days in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961, however, many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations. John is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record, with a path of 8,250\u00a0mi (13,280\u00a0km). Cyclone Rewa of the 1993\u201394 South Pacific and Australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere, traveling a distance of over 5,545\u00a0mi (8,920\u00a0km) during December 1993 and January 1994.\n\n[Climate of Hawaii]: Hawaii differs from many tropical locations with pronounced wet and dry seasons, in that the wet season coincides with the winter months (rather than the summer months more typical of other places in the tropics). For instance, Honolulu's K\u00f6ppen climate classification is the rare As wet-winter subcategory of the Tropical wet and dry climate type.\n\n[Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific information I need about the astronomical basis of months.

These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.\n\n[Observational astronomy]: Observational astronomy is a division of astronomy that is concerned with recording data about the observable universe, in contrast with theoretical astronomy, which is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice and study of observing celestial objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical instruments.\n\n[Lunar eclipse]: At least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year, although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common. If the date and time of an eclipse is known, the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an eclipse cycle, like the saros.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The previous searches have been unsuccessful in finding information about the astronomical basis of months.

I need to search more specifically for the definition of a month in astronomical terms and its relationship to celestial cycles.\n  Action: retrieve(astronomical definition of month lunar solar)\n  Observation: [July 2009 lunar eclipse]: An annular solar eclipse on January 26. A penumbral lunar eclipse on February 9. A penumbral lunar eclipse on July 7. A total solar eclipse on July 22. A penumbral lunar eclipse on August 6. A partial lunar eclipse on December 31. This eclipse is one of five lunar eclipses in a short-lived series. The lunar year series repeats after 12 lunations or 354 days (Shifting back about 10 days in sequential years). Because of the date shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events.\n\n[Easter]: In 725, Bede succinctly wrote, \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[August 2008 lunar eclipse]: A partial lunar eclipse took place on August 16, 2008, the second of two lunar eclipses in 2008, with the first being a total eclipse on February 20, 2008. The next lunar eclipse was a penumbral eclipse occurring on February 9, 2009, while the next total lunar eclipse occurred on December 21, 2010.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I still haven't found a clear explanation of whether months are based on the solar cycle. I need to search specifically for the different types of months (lunar, solar, etc.) and their astronomical definitions.\n  Action: retrieve(types of months sidereal synodic tropical)\n  Observation: [Tropical cyclone]: The smallest storm on record, Tropical Storm Marco, formed during October 2008 and made landfall in Veracruz. Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23\u00a0mi) in diameter. Hurricane John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting 31\u00a0days in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961, however, many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations. John is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record, with a path of 8,250\u00a0mi (13,280\u00a0km). Cyclone Rewa of the 1993\u201394 South Pacific and Australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere, traveling a distance of over 5,545\u00a0mi (8,920\u00a0km) during December 1993 and January 1994.\n\n[Climate of Hawaii]: Hawaii differs from many tropical locations with pronounced wet and dry seasons, in that the wet season coincides with the winter months (rather than the summer months more typical of other places in the tropics). For instance, Honolulu's K\u00f6ppen climate classification is the rare As wet-winter subcategory of the Tropical wet and dry climate type.\n\n[Tropical cyclone]: Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific information I need about the astronomical basis of months. I need to search for the fundamental definition of a month and its relationship to celestial cycles, particularly focusing on lunar vs solar cycles.\n  Action: retrieve(month definition astronomy lunar cycle)\n  Observation: [Astronomy]: Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.\n\n[Observational astronomy]: Observational astronomy is a division of astronomy that is concerned with recording data about the observable universe, in contrast with theoretical astronomy, which is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice and study of observing celestial objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical instruments.\n\n[Lunar eclipse]: At least two lunar eclipses and as many as five occur every year, although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common. If the date and time of an eclipse is known, the occurrences of upcoming eclipses are predictable using an eclipse cycle, like the saros.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The previous searches have been unsuccessful in finding information about the astronomical basis of months. I need to try a more precise search term that directly addresses the relationship between months and astronomical cycles.\n  Action: retrieve(are months based on lunar or solar cycles)\n  Observation: [Solar cycle]: Play media Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years. Solar maximum and solar minimum refer to periods of maximum and minimum sunspot counts. Cycles span from one minimum to the next.\n\n[July 2009 lunar eclipse]: An annular solar eclipse on January 26. A penumbral lunar eclipse on February 9. A penumbral lunar eclipse on July 7. A total solar eclipse on July 22. A penumbral lunar eclipse on August 6. A partial lunar eclipse on December 31. This eclipse is one of five lunar eclipses in a short-lived series. The lunar year series repeats after 12 lunations or 354 days (Shifting back about 10 days in sequential years). Because of the date shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events.\n\n[August 2008 lunar eclipse]: A partial lunar eclipse took place on August 16, 2008, the second of two lunar eclipses in 2008, with the first being a total eclipse on February 20, 2008. The next lunar eclipse was a penumbral eclipse occurring on February 9, 2009, while the next total lunar eclipse occurred on December 21, 2010.\nStep 8:\n  Thought: The searches so far have been returning information about solar cycles (sunspot cycles) and lunar eclipses, but not the fundamental definition of months. I need to be much more specific and use the term \"month\" in the context of calendar systems and astronomy. I should search for the different types of months that are defined by astronomers.\n  Action: retrieve(astronomical month types synodic sidereal)\n  Observation: [Easter]: In 725, Bede succinctly wrote, \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules. The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month. Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March.\n\n[Leap year]: A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (called intercalating in technical terminology) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a common year.\n\n[Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November. April and July. No month corresponds to August. Leap years January, April and July. February and August. March and November. No month corresponds to October. All years September and December. No month corresponds to May or June. In the months table below, corresponding months have the same number, a fact which follows directly from the definition.\nStep 9:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific information about different types of months. Let me try a more precise search for \"synodic month sidereal month definition\" to understand the astronomical basis of months.\n  Action: retrieve(synodic month sidereal month definition)\n  Observation: [Determination of the day of the week]: Common years January and October. February, March and November. April and July. No month corresponds to August. Leap years January, April and July. February and August. March and November. No month corresponds to October.

However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are in season.\n\n[February]: February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of summer (being the seasonal equivalent of what is August in the Northern Hemisphere).\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

Problems during pregnancy and birth A learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury. Risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight (3 pounds or less). These children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading.

Children who have learning disabilities often have parents who have the same struggle. Kids whose mother who has had less than 12 years of school are more likely to have a reading disability. Some children have spontaneous mutations (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities. One study estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations, for example a fault in the CDK13 gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected. Problems during pregnancy and birth A learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury. Risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight (3 pounds or less). These children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading. Children who are born prematurely, late, have a longer labor than usual, or have trouble receiving oxygen are more likely to develop a learning disability. Accidents after birth Learning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).{{}} Learning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists,speech language pathologists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech language pathologists, and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term \"disorder\" rather than \"disability\").\n\n[Learning disability]: Learning disability, learning disorder or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided information about pig intelligence or language capabilities.

Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.",

Children who have learning disabilities often have parents who have the same struggle. Kids whose mother who has had less than 12 years of school are more likely to have a reading disability. Some children have spontaneous mutations (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities. One study estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations, for example a fault in the CDK13 gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected. Problems during pregnancy and birth A learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury. Risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight (3 pounds or less). These children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading. Children who are born prematurely, late, have a longer labor than usual, or have trouble receiving oxygen are more likely to develop a learning disability. Accidents after birth Learning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).{{}} Learning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists,speech language pathologists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech language pathologists, and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term \"disorder\" rather than \"disability\").\n\n[Learning disability]: Learning disability, learning disorder or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided information about pig intelligence or language capabilities.

Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

For example, \"Wikipedia\" would become \"Ikipediaway\" (the \"W\" is moved from the beginning and has \"ay\" appended to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\n[Language]: A language is a structured system of communication.

Language, in a broader sense, is the method of communication that involves the use of \u2013 particularly human \u2013 languages.\n\n[Language development]: 0-1 years of age: An infant mainly uses non-verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I'm still not getting the specific information I need about pig cognitive abilities and language capabilities.

This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory.

Children who have learning disabilities often have parents who have the same struggle. Kids whose mother who has had less than 12 years of school are more likely to have a reading disability. Some children have spontaneous mutations (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities. One study estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations, for example a fault in the CDK13 gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected. Problems during pregnancy and birth A learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury. Risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight (3 pounds or less). These children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading. Children who are born prematurely, late, have a longer labor than usual, or have trouble receiving oxygen are more likely to develop a learning disability. Accidents after birth Learning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).{{}} Learning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists,speech language pathologists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech language pathologists, and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term \"disorder\" rather than \"disability\").\n\n[Learning disability]: Learning disability, learning disorder or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided information about pig intelligence or language capabilities.

For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \"mama\" and \"dada\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1\u20132 years of age: Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1\u20132 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2\u20133 years of age: Children aged 2\u20133 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3\u20135 years of age: In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z). At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5\u201310 years of age: Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child\u2019s vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10\u201318 years of age: By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual\u2019s style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I'm still not getting the specific information I need about pig cognitive abilities and language capabilities. Let me try a more direct approach to search for whether pigs have the cognitive capacity to understand and use language games like Pig Latin.\n  Action: retrieve(pig intelligence cognitive abilities language comprehension)\n  Observation: [Central Intelligence Agency]: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA [/sia\u026a\u02c8e\u026a/]) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States, tasked with gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n\n[Pig Latin]: The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little Pigskins, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin. YouTube). The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all-time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\n[Language]: One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: I'm having difficulty finding specific information about pig cognitive abilities through the retrieve function. Let me try a different approach - I'll look up whether pigs have the cognitive capacity to understand and use language games like Pig Latin based on what I know about animal cognition and pig intelligence.\n  Action: lookup(Do pigs have the cognitive ability to understand and use language games like Pig Latin?)\n  Observation: No, pigs do not have the cognitive ability to understand or use language games like Pig Latin.

A Scout who attains this rank is called an Eagle Scout. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million young men. Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements.\n\n[Boy Scouts of America]: Cub Scouts wear a uniform that gives each Scout a level of identity within the den, the pack and the community. The Scouts learn teamwork by meeting and working together in a den of four to ten boys or girls under adult leadership. They learn and apply the ideals codified in the Scout Oath and the Scout Law through an advancement system using age-based ranks earned by completing required and elective adventures. Some advancement is done in the home and is intended to involve the entire family and many Cub Scout activities include family members.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The retrieved information confirms that \"Cub Scouts\" is a youth group program where \"Cub\" refers to young participants (and metaphorically to young bears). \"Eagle Scout\" is a high rank within Scouts BSA, not a separate group label.

The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division.

The question is about whether \"eagles\" and \"young bears\" are used as labels for skills-training youth groups. I should first try to find out if there are any well-known youth groups or organizations that use these names. I'll start by searching for \"eagles youth group\" and \"young bears youth group\".\n  Action: retrieve(eagles youth group young bears youth group)\n  Observation: [In-group and out-group]: In sociology and social psychology, an in-group is a social group to which a person psychologically identifies as being a member. By contrast, an out-group is a social group with which an individual does not identify. People may for example identify with their peer group, family, community, sports team, political party, gender, religion, or nation. It has been found that the psychological membership of social groups and categories is associated with a wide variety of phenomena.\n\n[Golden eagle]: Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho. The hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in Idaho, showing that, out of 115 hunting attempts, 20% were successful in procuring prey. A fully-grown golden eagle requires about 230 to 250\u00a0g (8.1 to 8.8\u00a0oz) of food per day but in the life of most eagles there are cycles of feast and famine, and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week and then gorge on up to 900\u00a0g (2.0\u00a0lb) at one sitting.\n\n[Group (periodic table)]: v t e Groups in the Periodic table a Group 1 is composed of hydrogen (H) and the alkali metals. Elements of the group have one s-electron in the outer electron shell. Hydrogen is not considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to theirs, though it is more analogous to them than any other group. This makes the group somewhat exceptional. n/a Do not have a group number b Group 3 has scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y). For the rest of the group, sources differ as either being (1) lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr), or (2) lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or (3) the whole set of 15+15 lanthanides and actinides. IUPAC has initiated a project to standardize the definition as either (1) Sc, Y, Lu and Lr, or (2) Sc, Y, La and Ac. c Group 18, the noble gases, were not discovered at the time of Mendeleev's original table. Later (1902), Mendeleev accepted the evidence for their existence, and they could be placed in a new \"group 0\", consistently and without breaking the periodic table principle. r Group name as recommended by IUPAC. Some other names have been proposed and used without gaining wide acceptance: \"volatile metals\" for group 12; \"icosagens\" for group 13; \"crystallogens\", \"adamantogens\", and \"merylides\"[citation needed] for group 14; and \"aerogens\" for group 18.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The initial search didn't yield relevant results about youth groups. I need to be more specific. Let me search specifically for youth organizations that might use \"eagles\" or \"young bears\" in their names, focusing on skills-training groups.\n  Action: retrieve(eagles scouts young bears cub scouts)\n  Observation: [Scout (Scouting)]: While most Scouts may join a troop after finishing Cub Scouts, this is not required. As Scouts get older, they often seek more challenging and diverse activities. He may later join another affiliated program for older children, such as Exploring, Venturing, or Rovering.\n\n[Cub Scout]: Cub Scouts, Cubs or Wolf Cubs are programs associated with Scouting for young children usually between 5 and 12, depending on the national organization to which they belong. A participant in the program is called a Cub. A group of Cubs is called a 'Pack'.\n\n[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)]: Eagle Scout is the highest achievement or rank attainable in the Scouts BSA program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Since its inception in 1911, only four percent of Scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process. The Eagle Scout rank has been earned by over 2.5\u00a0million youth.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The search results mention Cub Scouts and Eagle Scouts, which are both related to youth groups. \"Cubs\" might refer to young bears, and \"Eagle\" is a rank in Scouting. I should look up more details about these terms to see if they are used as labels for skills-training youth groups.\n  Action: lookup(What is the meaning of \"Cub\" in Cub Scouts?)\n  Observation: Based on the provided context, \"Cub\" is the term for a participant in the Cub Scouts program. The program is for young children, and a group of Cubs is called a 'Pack'.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: Now I need to understand what \"Eagle\" refers to in the scouting context. The previous result mentioned Eagle Scout is the highest rank in Scouts BSA, but I should confirm if \"Eagles\" is used as a label for a youth group itself.\n  Action: lookup(What does \"Eagle\" refer to in scouting?)\n  Observation: In Scouting, \"Eagle\" refers to the highest achievement or rank attainable in the Scouts BSA program of the Boy Scouts of America.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: I have information about Eagle Scout as a rank and Cub Scouts as a program. The question asks if \"eagles\" and \"young bears\" are used as labels for skills-training youth groups. \"Young bears\" likely refers to Cub Scouts (since cubs are young bears), and \"eagles\" refers to Eagle Scouts. However, I need to confirm if these are indeed used as group labels. Eagle Scout is a rank, not a group itself, while Cub Scouts is a group. Let me search for more specific information about how these terms are used in youth organizations.\n  Action: retrieve(Eagle Scout group Cub Scouts group skills training)\n  Observation: [Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)]: Eagle Scout is the highest achievement or rank attainable in the Scouts BSA program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Since its inception in 1911, only four percent of Scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process. The Eagle Scout rank has been earned by over 2.5\u00a0million youth.\n\n[Boy Scouts of America]: Eagle Scout is the highest rank one can receive in Scouts BSA. A Scout who attains this rank is called an Eagle Scout. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million young men. Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements.\n\n[Boy Scouts of America]: Cub Scouts wear a uniform that gives each Scout a level of identity within the den, the pack and the community. The Scouts learn teamwork by meeting and working together in a den of four to ten boys or girls under adult leadership. They learn and apply the ideals codified in the Scout Oath and the Scout Law through an advancement system using age-based ranks earned by completing required and elective adventures. Some advancement is done in the home and is intended to involve the entire family and many Cub Scout activities include family members.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: The retrieved information confirms that \"Cub Scouts\" is a youth group program where \"Cub\" refers to young participants (and metaphorically to young bears). \"Eagle Scout\" is a high rank within Scouts BSA, not a separate group label. I need to determine if these qualify as \"labels for skills-training youth groups.\" Cub Scouts clearly is a skills-training youth group. For \"eagles,\" while it's a rank, it might still be used as a label in a broader sense. Let me evaluate based on what I know.\n  Action: evaluate(Are Cub Scouts and Eagle Scouts considered labels for skills-training youth groups?)\n  Observation: True\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The evaluation step has confirmed that both Cub Scouts (which can be associated with \"young bears\" since cubs are young bears) and Eagle Scouts (referring to the rank) are indeed part of skills-training youth groups. However, I need to ensure that \"eagles\" is used as a label for a group, not just a rank. Let me search specifically for any youth group that might be called \"Eagles\" or similar.\n  Action: retrieve(Eagles\" youth group organization skills training)\n  Observation: [Skills management]: There are different types of skills in the corporate world. Soft Skills, communication skills, business writing, corporate presentation, public speaking, sales, marketing, leadership and managerial skills are few of the skills.\n\n[Golden eagle]: Golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours, but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho.

If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain. Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the sh\u014dgun's palace) still has a gate called Hanz\u014d's Gate (Hanz\u014dmon), and the Hanz\u014dmon subway line which runs from Hanz\u014dmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located. The neighborhood outside Hanz\u014d's Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-ch\u014d (\"Iga Town\"). Hanz\u014d's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spear and his ceremonial battle helmet. The spear, originally 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) long and given to him by Ieyasu, was donated to the temple by Hanz\u014d as a votive offering, but was damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in 1945.",

Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain. Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the sh\u014dgun's palace) still has a gate called Hanz\u014d's Gate (Hanz\u014dmon), and the Hanz\u014dmon subway line which runs from Hanz\u014dmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located. The neighborhood outside Hanz\u014d's Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-ch\u014d (\"Iga Town\"). Hanz\u014d's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spear and his ceremonial battle helmet. The spear, originally 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) long and given to him by Ieyasu, was donated to the temple by Hanz\u014d as a votive offering, but was damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in 1945."

If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur.

In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values.

The neighborhood outside Hanz\u014d's Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-ch\u014d (\"Iga Town\"). Hanz\u014d's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spear and his ceremonial battle helmet. The spear, originally 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) long and given to him by Ieyasu, was donated to the temple by Hanz\u014d as a votive offering, but was damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in 1945.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain specific details about Pikachu's personality or preferences.

Pikachu is a fictional Pok\u00e9mon character, and Charles Darwin is a historical scientist. I should search for information about both to see if there is any documented interaction or statement about Pikachu's feelings toward Darwin.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Charles Darwin)\n  Observation: [Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\n\n[Charles Darwin]: Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/; 12 February 1809\u00a0\u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\n\n[On the Origin of Species]: On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information only provides background on Charles Darwin and his work, but doesn't mention Pikachu at all. I need to specifically search for any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin, or any information about Pikachu's preferences or opinions.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu's likes preferences opinions)\n  Observation: [Richard Dawkins]: Dawkins has been awarded academic and writing awards, and he makes television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.\n\n[Managed care]: There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n\n[Goldfish]: Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't found any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin. I need to specifically search for information about Pikachu's character traits, preferences, or any canonical statements about what Pikachu likes or dislikes.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu character personality likes dislikes)\n  Observation: [Depression (mood)]: Changes in personality or in one's social environment can affect levels of depression. High scores on the personality domain neuroticism make the development of depressive symptoms as well as all kinds of depression diagnoses more likely, and depression is associated with low extraversion. Other personality indicators could be: temporary but rapid mood changes, short term hopelessness, loss of interest in activities that used to be of a part of one's life, sleep disruption, withdrawal from previous social life, appetite changes, and difficulty concentrating.\n\n[Dissociative identity disorder]: Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. This is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The personalities alternately show in a person's behavior; presentations, however, are variable. Other problems that often occur in people with DID include borderline personality disorder (BPD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance use disorders, self-harm, and anxiety.\n\n[Donald Duck]: Donald Fauntleroy Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain any relevant information about Pikachu's preferences or any connection to Charles Darwin.

There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve.

Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the sh\u014dgun's palace) still has a gate called Hanz\u014d's Gate (Hanz\u014dmon), and the Hanz\u014dmon subway line which runs from Hanz\u014dmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located. The neighborhood outside Hanz\u014d's Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-ch\u014d (\"Iga Town\"). Hanz\u014d's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spear and his ceremonial battle helmet.

At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player.

Pikachu is a fictional Pok\u00e9mon character, and Charles Darwin is a historical scientist. I should search for information about both to see if there is any documented interaction or statement about Pikachu's feelings toward Darwin.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Charles Darwin)\n  Observation: [Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\n\n[Charles Darwin]: Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/; 12 February 1809\u00a0\u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\n\n[On the Origin of Species]: On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information only provides background on Charles Darwin and his work, but doesn't mention Pikachu at all. I need to specifically search for any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin, or any information about Pikachu's preferences or opinions.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu's likes preferences opinions)\n  Observation: [Richard Dawkins]: Dawkins has been awarded academic and writing awards, and he makes television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.\n\n[Managed care]: There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n\n[Goldfish]: Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't found any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin. I need to specifically search for information about Pikachu's character traits, preferences, or any canonical statements about what Pikachu likes or dislikes.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu character personality likes dislikes)\n  Observation: [Depression (mood)]: Changes in personality or in one's social environment can affect levels of depression. High scores on the personality domain neuroticism make the development of depressive symptoms as well as all kinds of depression diagnoses more likely, and depression is associated with low extraversion. Other personality indicators could be: temporary but rapid mood changes, short term hopelessness, loss of interest in activities that used to be of a part of one's life, sleep disruption, withdrawal from previous social life, appetite changes, and difficulty concentrating.\n\n[Dissociative identity disorder]: Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. This is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The personalities alternately show in a person's behavior; presentations, however, are variable. Other problems that often occur in people with DID include borderline personality disorder (BPD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance use disorders, self-harm, and anxiety.\n\n[Donald Duck]: Donald Fauntleroy Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain any relevant information about Pikachu's preferences or any connection to Charles Darwin.

McFarlane Toys' first series of action figures were released in October 2008 and consists of four different figures: Marine with Flamethrower, Marine Infantry, British Special Ops, and Marine with Machine Gun.\n\n[Historical fiction]: Works of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly criticism or genre expectations for accurate period details. This tension between historical authenticity, or historicity, and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics, while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary, investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests.\n\n[Table of food nutrients]: The tables below include tabular lists for selected basic foods, compiled from United States Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) sources. Included for each food is its weight in grams, its calories, and (also in grams,) the amount of protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fat, and saturated fat. As foods vary by brands and stores, the figures should only be considered estimates, with more exact figures often included on product labels. For precise details about vitamins and mineral contents, the USDA source can be used.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: I still haven't found any information about Pikachu's specific preferences or opinions about historical figures.

If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain.

Pikachu is a fictional Pok\u00e9mon character, and Charles Darwin is a historical scientist. I should search for information about both to see if there is any documented interaction or statement about Pikachu's feelings toward Darwin.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Charles Darwin)\n  Observation: [Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\n\n[Charles Darwin]: Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/; 12 February 1809\u00a0\u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\n\n[On the Origin of Species]: On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information only provides background on Charles Darwin and his work, but doesn't mention Pikachu at all. I need to specifically search for any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin, or any information about Pikachu's preferences or opinions.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu's likes preferences opinions)\n  Observation: [Richard Dawkins]: Dawkins has been awarded academic and writing awards, and he makes television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.\n\n[Managed care]: There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n\n[Goldfish]: Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't found any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin. I need to specifically search for information about Pikachu's character traits, preferences, or any canonical statements about what Pikachu likes or dislikes.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu character personality likes dislikes)\n  Observation: [Depression (mood)]: Changes in personality or in one's social environment can affect levels of depression. High scores on the personality domain neuroticism make the development of depressive symptoms as well as all kinds of depression diagnoses more likely, and depression is associated with low extraversion. Other personality indicators could be: temporary but rapid mood changes, short term hopelessness, loss of interest in activities that used to be of a part of one's life, sleep disruption, withdrawal from previous social life, appetite changes, and difficulty concentrating.\n\n[Dissociative identity disorder]: Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. This is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The personalities alternately show in a person's behavior; presentations, however, are variable. Other problems that often occur in people with DID include borderline personality disorder (BPD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance use disorders, self-harm, and anxiety.\n\n[Donald Duck]: Donald Fauntleroy Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain any relevant information about Pikachu's preferences or any connection to Charles Darwin.

Pikachu is a fictional Pok\u00e9mon character, and Charles Darwin is a historical scientist. I should search for information about both to see if there is any documented interaction or statement about Pikachu's feelings toward Darwin.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Charles Darwin)\n  Observation: [Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species.

Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information only provides background on Charles Darwin and his work, but doesn't mention Pikachu at all. I need to specifically search for any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin, or any information about Pikachu's preferences or opinions.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu's likes preferences opinions)\n  Observation: [Richard Dawkins]: Dawkins has been awarded academic and writing awards, and he makes television, radio, and Internet appearances, predominantly discussing his books, atheism, and his ideas and opinions as a public intellectual.\n\n[Managed care]: There are basically two types of health insurance: fee-for-service (indemnity) and managed care. Policies may vary from low cost to all-inclusive to meet different demands of customers, depending on needs, preferences and budget. Fee-for-service is a traditional kind of health care policy: insurance companies pay medical staff fees for each service provided to an insured patient. Such plans offer a wide choice of doctors and hospitals.\n\n[Goldfish]: Goldfish-specific food has less protein and more carbohydrate than conventional fish food. Enthusiasts may supplement this diet with shelled peas (with outer skins removed), blanched green leafy vegetables, and bloodworms. Young goldfish benefit from the addition of brine shrimp to their diet. As with all animals, goldfish preferences vary.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches haven't found any connection between Pikachu and Charles Darwin. I need to specifically search for information about Pikachu's character traits, preferences, or any canonical statements about what Pikachu likes or dislikes.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu character personality likes dislikes)\n  Observation: [Depression (mood)]: Changes in personality or in one's social environment can affect levels of depression. High scores on the personality domain neuroticism make the development of depressive symptoms as well as all kinds of depression diagnoses more likely, and depression is associated with low extraversion. Other personality indicators could be: temporary but rapid mood changes, short term hopelessness, loss of interest in activities that used to be of a part of one's life, sleep disruption, withdrawal from previous social life, appetite changes, and difficulty concentrating.\n\n[Dissociative identity disorder]: Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. This is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The personalities alternately show in a person's behavior; presentations, however, are variable. Other problems that often occur in people with DID include borderline personality disorder (BPD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance use disorders, self-harm, and anxiety.\n\n[Donald Duck]: Donald Fauntleroy Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain any relevant information about Pikachu's preferences or any connection to Charles Darwin. I need to try a more specific search about Pikachu's character from Pok\u00e9mon sources.\n  Action: retrieve(Pikachu Pok\u00e9mon personality characteristics)\n  Observation: [Pok\u00e9mon]: In most incarnations of the Pok\u00e9mon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon is able to capture that Pok\u00e9mon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Pok\u00e9 Ball at it. If the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pok\u00e9mon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pok\u00e9mon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pok\u00e9mon; if the opposing Pok\u00e9mon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pok\u00e9mon with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, and in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pok\u00e9mon encountered by players can be caught in Pok\u00e9 Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pok\u00e9mon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pok\u00e9mon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\"faints\"), the winning Pok\u00e9mon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9 Balls. When leveling up, the Pok\u00e9mon's battling aptitude statistics (\"stats\", such as \"Attack\" and \"Speed\") increase. At certain levels, the Pok\u00e9mon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pok\u00e9mon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pok\u00e9mon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pok\u00e9mon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"Mega Evolution,\" by which certain fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.\n\n[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon]: Evolution (\u9032\u5316, shinka) is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in stat values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\n[Hattori Hanz\u014d]: To this day, artifacts of Hanz\u014d's legacy remain. Tokyo Imperial Palace (formerly the sh\u014dgun's palace) still has a gate called Hanz\u014d's Gate (Hanz\u014dmon), and the Hanz\u014dmon subway line which runs from Hanz\u014dmon Station in central Tokyo to the southwestern suburbs is named after the gate, where his house was once located. The neighborhood outside Hanz\u014d's Gate is known as Wakaba, but before 1943 was named Iga-ch\u014d (\"Iga Town\"). Hanz\u014d's remains now rest in the Sainen-ji temple cemetery in Yotsuya, Tokyo. The temple also holds his favorite spear and his ceremonial battle helmet. The spear, originally 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) long and given to him by Ieyasu, was donated to the temple by Hanz\u014d as a votive offering, but was damaged during the bombing of Tokyo in 1945.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The retrieved information still doesn't contain specific details about Pikachu's personality or preferences.

McFarlane Toys' first series of action figures were released in October 2008 and consists of four different figures: Marine with Flamethrower, Marine Infantry, British Special Ops, and Marine with Machine Gun.\n\n[Historical fiction]: Works of historical fiction are sometimes criticized for lack of authenticity because of readerly criticism or genre expectations for accurate period details. This tension between historical authenticity, or historicity, and fiction frequently becomes a point of comment for readers and popular critics, while scholarly criticism frequently goes beyond this commentary, investigating the genre for its other thematic and critical interests.\n\n[Table of food nutrients]: The tables below include tabular lists for selected basic foods, compiled from United States Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) sources. Included for each food is its weight in grams, its calories, and (also in grams,) the amount of protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, fat, and saturated fat. As foods vary by brands and stores, the figures should only be considered estimates, with more exact figures often included on product labels. For precise details about vitamins and mineral contents, the USDA source can be used.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: I still haven't found any information about Pikachu's specific preferences or opinions about historical figures.

His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.

They are divided into two categories: City Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NALC, and Rural Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70\u00a0lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday. Rural carriers are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.

Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage.\n\n[Party]: In Western cultures, birthday parties include a number of common rituals. The guests may be asked to bring a gift for the honored person. Party locations are often decorated with colorful decorations, such as balloons and streamers. A birthday cake is usually served with lit candles that are to be blown out after a \"birthday wish\" has been made. The person being honored will be given the first piece of cake. While the birthday cake is being brought to the table, the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" or some other birthday song is sung by the guests.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The retrieved information mentions Washington's Birthday as a federal holiday, and George Washington was a unanimously elected president.

They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.

Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively. Other non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches have not yielded the specific list of federal holidays or the criteria for mail delivery breaks. I need to directly look up the official list of federal holidays to see which presidents' birthdays are included. Since George Washington is the only unanimously elected president whose birthday is a federal holiday, I should check if there is any special rule for unanimously elected presidents.\n  Action: lookup(list of federal holidays in the United States)\n  Observation: Based on the provided context, there is no list of federal holidays. The context only mentions objections to specific federal holidays like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Columbus Day.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: Since the retrieved context does not contain the list of federal holidays, I need to search for it more specifically. I should also clarify if \"unanimously elected\" is a formal criterion for a holiday. I'll try a different query.\n  Action: retrieve(list of federal holidays\" USPS)\n  Observation: [Federal holidays in the United States]: Some individuals and organizations have objected to the federal status of certain holidays, such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Columbus Day. In particular, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina opposed the creation of the federal holiday for the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1983.\n\n[Northern Mariana Islands]: Mail service for the islands is provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Each major island has its own zip code in the 96950\u201396952 range, and the USPS two-letter abbreviation for the CNMI is MP. For phone service, the islands are included in the North American Numbering Plan, using area code 670.\n\n[Federal government of the United States]: The federal government of the United States (U.S. federal government) is the national government of the United States, a federal republic in North America, composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories and several island possessions. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the president and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The retrieved context still doesn't provide the list of federal holidays. I need to search more specifically for the official USPS holiday schedule or the complete list of federal holidays to see which presidents' birthdays are observed. I should also check if \"unanimously elected\" is a criterion mentioned anywhere.\n  Action: retrieve(USPS holiday schedule\" \"no mail delivery)\n  Observation: [Northern Mariana Islands]: Mail service for the islands is provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Each major island has its own zip code in the 96950\u201396952 range, and the USPS two-letter abbreviation for the CNMI is MP. For phone service, the islands are included in the North American Numbering Plan, using area code 670.\n\n[United States Postal Service]: Mail carriers, also referred to as mailmen or letter carriers, prepare and deliver mail and parcels. They are divided into two categories: City Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NALC, and Rural Letter Carriers, who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70\u00a0lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday. Rural carriers are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted. Mail handlers and processors, prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches. Clerks, have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively. Other non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n\n[ZIP Code]: In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called \"plus-four codes\", \"add-on codes\", or \"add-ons\". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required. In general, mail is read by a multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific delivery point\u2014and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\nStep 8:\n  Thought: The previous searches have not successfully retrieved the list of federal holidays or the USPS holiday schedule. I need to try a different approach. I should search for the specific term \"Presidents' Day\" or \"Washington's Birthday\" to confirm it is a federal holiday and then check if other unanimously elected presidents (like Washington) have their birthdays observed. I also need to confirm if \"unanimously elected\" is a formal criterion for a holiday.\n  Action: retrieve(Presidents' Day\" federal holiday USPS)\n  Observation: [Federal holidays in the United States]: New Year's Day Independence Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day George Washington's Birthday became a Federal holiday in 1879. In 1888 and 1894, respectively, Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) and Labor Day were created. In 1938, Armistice Day (now Veterans Day) was created to mark the end of World War I. The scope and the name of the holiday was expanded in 1954 to honor Americans who fought in World War II and the Korean War.\n\n[Veterans Day]: citation needed] Because it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employee can choose some other day. A Society for Human Resource Management poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011.\n\n[Postal holiday]: Part 608, section 3.2 of the DMM (U.S. Domestic Mail Manual) groups holidays into \"Widely Observed\" and \"Not Widely Observed\". Holidays \"Widely Observed\" include New Year\u2019s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Holidays \"Not Widely Observed\" are Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s Birthday; Presidents Day; Columbus Day; and Veterans Day.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

If they are not native, I should check if there are any zoos or facilities in Memphis that house them, making a photo opportunity possible. First, I'll search for information about the natural habitat of Saltwater crocodiles and then about their presence in Memphis.\n  Action: retrieve(Saltwater crocodile habitat distribution)\n  Observation: [Crocodile]: Size greatly varies among species, from the dwarf crocodile to the saltwater crocodile. Species of the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just 1.5 to 1.9\u00a0m (4.9 to 6.2\u00a0ft), whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to sizes over 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and weigh 1,000\u00a0kg (2,200\u00a0lb). Several other large species can reach over 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) long and weigh over 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) long. The largest species of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in eastern India, northern Australia, throughout South-east Asia, and in the surrounding waters.\n\n[Saltwater crocodile]: The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is a crocodilian native to saltwater habitats and brackish wetlands from India's east coast across Southeast Asia and the Sundaic region to northern Australia and Micronesia. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It was hunted for its skin throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous for people who share the same environment.\n\n[Crocodile]: Subfamily Crocodylinae Genus Crocodylus Crocodylus acutus, American crocodile Crocodylus intermedius, Orinoco crocodile Crocodylus johnsoni, freshwater crocodile, or Johnstone's crocodile Crocodylus mindorensis, Philippine crocodile Crocodylus moreletii, Morelet's crocodile or Mexican crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, Nile crocodile or African crocodile (the subspecies found in Madagascar is sometimes called the black crocodile) Crocodylus novaeguineae, New Guinea crocodile Crocodylus palustris, mugger, marsh or Indian crocodile Crocodylus porosus, saltwater crocodile or estuarine crocodile Crocodylus rhombifer, Cuban crocodile Crocodylus siamensis, Siamese crocodile (may be extinct in the wild) Crocodylus suchus, West African crocodile, desert or sacred crocodile Genus Osteolaemus Osteolaemus tetraspis, dwarf crocodile (There has been controversy as to whether or not this is actually two species; recent (2010) DNA analysis indicate three distinct species: O. tetraspis, O. osborni and a third, currently unnamed.)

Brochu and Glenn W. Storrs. Many extinct species of Crocodylus might represent different genera. \"Crocodylus\" pigotti, for example, was placed in the newly erected genus Brochuchus in 2013. C. suchus was not included because its morphological codings were identical to those of C. niloticus. However, the authors suggested that the lack of differences was due to limited specimen sampling, and considered the two species to be distinct. This analysis found weak support for the clade Osteolaeminae. Brochu named Osteolaeminae in 2003 as a subfamily of Crocodylidae separate from Crocodylinae, but the group has since been classified within Crocodylinae. It includes the living genus Osteolaemus as well as the extinct species Voay robustus and Rimasuchus lloydi.\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information confirms that saltwater crocodiles are native to regions like eastern India, northern Australia, and Southeast Asia, but not to North America.

Performers such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Robert Wilkins, Joe McCoy, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie used a variety of unusual instruments such as washboard, fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. Memphis Minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. Pianist Memphis Slim began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements.

Species of the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just 1.5 to 1.9\u00a0m (4.9 to 6.2\u00a0ft), whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to sizes over 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and weigh 1,000\u00a0kg (2,200\u00a0lb). Several other large species can reach over 5.2\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft) long and weigh over 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). Crocodilians show pronounced sexual dimorphism, with males growing much larger and more rapidly than females. Despite their large adult sizes, crocodiles start their lives at around 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) long.

As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information mentions that the 2 euro coin is made of nickel brass and copper-nickel, but it doesn't provide the density of these materials or the coin itself.

While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant.

Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information mentions that the 2 euro coin is made of nickel brass and copper-nickel, but it doesn't provide the density of these materials or the coin itself. I need to find more specific information about the density of the materials used in euro coins. I should search for the density of the specific alloys.\n  Action: retrieve(nickel brass density copper-nickel density)\n  Observation: [Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations. Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water.

The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water.

The coin sports the profile of George Washington on its obverse, and its reverse design has changed frequently. It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Nickel (United States coin)]: A nickel, in American usage, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint. Composed of 75%\u00a0copper and 25% nickel, the piece has been issued since 1866. Its diameter is .835 inches (21.21\u00a0mm) and its thickness is .077 inches (1.95\u00a0mm). Due to inflation, the purchasing power of the nickel continues to drop and currently the coin represents less than 1% of the federal hourly minimum wage. In 2018, over 1.26 billion nickels were produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific mass and dimensions of Euro coins needed to calculate density.

It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Euro]: The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.83 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008. However, the currency is lower than the original issue rate of US$1.1743, showing a relative decline since its issuance. In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis, which led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising and strengthening the currency.\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

I should first search for information about the composition and physical properties of Euro coins.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin composition density)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. The coin is used in 22 countries (with 20 legally adopting it) with a collective population of about 341\u00a0million. The coin is made of two alloys: the inner part of nickel brass, the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).\nStep 2:\n  Thought: The retrieved information mentions that the 2 euro coin is made of nickel brass and copper-nickel, but it doesn't provide the density of these materials or the coin itself. I need to find more specific information about the density of the materials used in euro coins. I should search for the density of the specific alloys.\n  Action: retrieve(nickel brass density copper-nickel density)\n  Observation: [Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations. Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\nStep 3:\n  Thought: The previous searches didn't provide the specific density values I need.

The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific density values for euro coins or their component alloys. Let me try a more precise search for the physical specifications of euro coins, including their mass and dimensions, so I can calculate density.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin specifications mass diameter thickness)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.

The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Quarter (United States coin)]: The quarter, short for quarter dollar, is a United States coin worth 25 cents, one-quarter of a dollar. It has a diameter of .955 inch (24.26\u00a0mm) and a thickness of .069 inch (1.75\u00a0mm). The coin sports the profile of George Washington on its obverse, and its reverse design has changed frequently. It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Nickel (United States coin)]: A nickel, in American usage, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint. Composed of 75%\u00a0copper and 25% nickel, the piece has been issued since 1866. Its diameter is .835 inches (21.21\u00a0mm) and its thickness is .077 inches (1.95\u00a0mm). Due to inflation, the purchasing power of the nickel continues to drop and currently the coin represents less than 1% of the federal hourly minimum wage. In 2018, over 1.26 billion nickels were produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific mass and dimensions of Euro coins needed to calculate density. Let me try a more precise search for the technical specifications of 1 and 2 Euro coins, as these are the most common denominations that people might test for sinking.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin technical specifications mass diameter thickness European Central Bank)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.

The coin sports the profile of George Washington on its obverse, and its reverse design has changed frequently. It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Euro]: The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.83 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008. However, the currency is lower than the original issue rate of US$1.1743, showing a relative decline since its issuance. In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis, which led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising and strengthening the currency.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific mass and dimensions needed to calculate density. Let me try a different approach and search specifically for the density of the alloys used in euro coins, particularly nickel brass and copper-nickel.\n  Action: retrieve(density of nickel brass alloy g/cm3)\n  Observation: [Metal]: Although most elemental metals have higher densities than most nonmetals, there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense (0.534\u00a0g/cm3) and osmium (22.59\u00a0g/cm3) the most dense. Magnesium, aluminium and titanium are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their respective densities of 1.7, 2.7 and 4.5\u00a0g/cm3 can be compared to those of the older structural metals, like iron at 7.9 and copper at 8.9\u00a0g/cm3. An iron ball would thus weigh about as much as three aluminium balls.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy.

I need to try a different approach and search for whether Euro coins float or sink in water directly, as this might be documented somewhere.\n  Action: retrieve(Do Euro coins float in water sink)\n  Observation: [Euro coins]: Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins.

Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\nStep 4:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific density values for euro coins or their component alloys. Let me try a more precise search for the physical specifications of euro coins, including their mass and dimensions, so I can calculate density.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin specifications mass diameter thickness)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. The coin is used in 22 countries (with 20 legally adopting it) with a collective population of about 341\u00a0million. The coin is made of two alloys: the inner part of nickel brass, the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Quarter (United States coin)]: The quarter, short for quarter dollar, is a United States coin worth 25 cents, one-quarter of a dollar. It has a diameter of .955 inch (24.26\u00a0mm) and a thickness of .069 inch (1.75\u00a0mm). The coin sports the profile of George Washington on its obverse, and its reverse design has changed frequently. It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Nickel (United States coin)]: A nickel, in American usage, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint. Composed of 75%\u00a0copper and 25% nickel, the piece has been issued since 1866. Its diameter is .835 inches (21.21\u00a0mm) and its thickness is .077 inches (1.95\u00a0mm). Due to inflation, the purchasing power of the nickel continues to drop and currently the coin represents less than 1% of the federal hourly minimum wage. In 2018, over 1.26 billion nickels were produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints.\nStep 5:\n  Thought: The previous searches still haven't provided the specific mass and dimensions of Euro coins needed to calculate density. Let me try a more precise search for the technical specifications of 1 and 2 Euro coins, as these are the most common denominations that people might test for sinking.\n  Action: retrieve(Euro coin technical specifications mass diameter thickness European Central Bank)\n  Observation: [2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.

It has been produced on and off since 1796 and consistently since 1831.\n\n[Euro]: The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was introduced to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU) at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.83 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008. However, the currency is lower than the original issue rate of US$1.1743, showing a relative decline since its issuance. In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis, which led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising and strengthening the currency.\nStep 6:\n  Thought: I still haven't found the specific mass and dimensions needed to calculate density. Let me try a different approach and search specifically for the density of the alloys used in euro coins, particularly nickel brass and copper-nickel.\n  Action: retrieve(density of nickel brass alloy g/cm3)\n  Observation: [Metal]: Although most elemental metals have higher densities than most nonmetals, there is a wide variation in their densities, lithium being the least dense (0.534\u00a0g/cm3) and osmium (22.59\u00a0g/cm3) the most dense. Magnesium, aluminium and titanium are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their respective densities of 1.7, 2.7 and 4.5\u00a0g/cm3 can be compared to those of the older structural metals, like iron at 7.9 and copper at 8.9\u00a0g/cm3. An iron ball would thus weigh about as much as three aluminium balls.\n\n[Nickel]: Nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, it has been used for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.\n\n[Nickel allergy]: Nickel is present in a wide range of foods, in varying concentrations. Adults with ongoing nickel allergic contact dermatitis that does not respond to clinical treatments are recommended to follow a low-nickel diet and avoid foods such as chocolate, granola, oatmeal, and beans. While systemic elicitation of ACD in individuals sensitized by direct skin contact is well documented for a small proportion of nickel-sensitized individuals, there exists some controversy about the ability to sensitize individuals when nickel exposure is oral, intravenous, or inhaled. Only about 1\u201310% of dietary nickel is absorbed by the body. Average daily-ingested intake of nickel is about 200 micrograms. A few studies have shown that nickel-sensitive individuals given greater than 5,000 micrograms nickel (as NiSO4) as a single oral dose had a nickel ACD response. While such exposures are in excess of those encountered in normal diets, some researchers suggest that dietary control of nickel intake may help in the ongoing treatment of nickel ACD caused by other sources. These researchers have correctly identified foods high in nickel content (e.g., nuts, chocolate, beans), but they have sometimes incorrectly advocated the avoidance of cutlery, bowls, etc. made from stainless steel, which do not release significant amounts of nickel.\nStep 7:\n  Thought: The previous searches have been unsuccessful in finding the specific density or physical specifications of Euro coins. I need to try a different approach and search for whether Euro coins float or sink in water directly, as this might be documented somewhere.\n  Action: retrieve(Do Euro coins float in water sink)\n  Observation: [Euro coins]: Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\n\n[Euro]: The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\n[2 euro coin]: The coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers (nickel brass, nickel, nickel brass) and the outer ring of copper-nickel giving them a two colour (silver outer and gold inner) appearance. The diameter of the coins is 25.75\u00a0mm, the thickness is 2.20\u00a0mm and the mass is 8.5\u00a0grams. The coins' edges are finely milled with lettering, though the exact design of the edge can vary between states with some choosing to write the issuing state's name or denomination around the edge (see \"edges\" below). The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999 which is the year the euro was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.\nStep 8:\n  Thought: Great! I finally found the mass and dimensions of the 2 euro coin: mass is 8.5 grams, diameter is 25.75 mm, and thickness is 2.20 mm.

Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit.

For example, a \u20ac2 coin (a cylinder with a radius of 12.875 mm and height of 2.20 mm) would have a volume of approximately \u03c0 * (12.875)\u00b2 * 2.20 mm\u00b3.\nStep 9:\n  Thought: Now I need to calculate the volume of the 2 euro coin using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. The diameter is 25.75 mm, so the radius is half of that (12.875 mm). The thickness (height) is 2.20 mm. I'll calculate the volume in mm\u00b3 and then convert to cm\u00b3 since density is typically measured in g/cm\u00b3.\n  Action: evaluate(Calculate volume: \u03c0 * (12.875)\n  Observation: True\n\nWhat's your next step?\n\nThought:",

Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\n\n[Euro]: The currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.\n\n[2 euro coin]: The coins are composed of two alloys. The inner circle is composed of three layers (nickel brass, nickel, nickel brass) and the outer ring of copper-nickel giving them a two colour (silver outer and gold inner) appearance. The diameter of the coins is 25.75\u00a0mm, the thickness is 2.20\u00a0mm and the mass is 8.5\u00a0grams. The coins' edges are finely milled with lettering, though the exact design of the edge can vary between states with some choosing to write the issuing state's name or denomination around the edge (see \"edges\" below). The coins have been used from 2002, though some are dated 1999 which is the year the euro was created as a currency, but not put into general circulation.\n- How to calculate the volume of a cylinder: The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. For example, a \u20ac2 coin (a cylinder with a radius of 12.875 mm and height of 2.20 mm) would have a volume of approximately \u03c0 * (12.875)\u00b2 * 2.20 mm\u00b3.\n\nCondition: \u03c0 \u00d7 (12.875\n\nIs this True or False?
