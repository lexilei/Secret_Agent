However, a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or other approved ID can be used for domestic flights until May 2025.\n- Mark Cuban is a U.S. citizen.\n\nTherefore, if Mark Cuban is traveling by air (which is typical for reaching the Northern Mariana Islands), he would need a passport or a REAL ID-compliant driver's license until May 2025. After that, a passport will be required for air travel. If he were traveling by sea from another U.S. territory or location, a passport might not be required.\n\nHowever, the original question asks if he is able to visit without a passport. Since the Northern Mariana Islands are remote and most travel is by air, and given the current regulations, he would generally need a passport (or REAL ID until May 2025) for air travel. But technically, it is possible without a passport if traveling by sea from another U.S. location.\n\nGiven the context and the facts, the answer is **No**, because for practical purposes (air travel), a passport is required.
