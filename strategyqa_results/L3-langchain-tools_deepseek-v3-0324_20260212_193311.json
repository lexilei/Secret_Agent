It is a solar calendar, based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each year begins on the day of the March equinox and has years of 365 or 366 days. It is sometimes also called the Shamsi calendar, Khorshidi calendar or Persian calendar and the most recent of the Iranian calendars. It is abbreviated as SH, HS, AP, or, sometimes as AHSh, while the lunar Hijri calendar (commonly known in the West as the 'Islamic calendar') is usually abbreviated as AH.\nThe epoch (very first day) of the Solar Hijri calendar was the day of the spring equinox, March 19, 622 CE. The calendar is a \"Hijri calendar\" because that was the year that Mohammed is believed to have left from Mecca to Medina, which event is referred to as the Hijrah.\nThe calendar is widely used by many Central Asian & West Asian ethnic groups, such as Kurds, Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Persians, Azerbaijanis, Yaz"

Sunspots have been observed since the early 17th century and the sunspot time series is the longest, continuously observed (recorded) time series of any natural phenomena. Accompanying the 11 year quasi-periodicity in sunspots, the large-scale dipolar (north-south) magnetic field component of the Sun also flips every 11 years, however, the peak in the dipolar field lags the peak in the sunspot number, with the former occurring at the minimum between two cycles. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years. This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun's appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as auroras. Solar activity, driven both by the sunspot cycle and transient aperiodic processes govern the environment of the Solar System planets by creating space weather and impact space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth's atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.\n\n[Solar cycle]: Play media Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years.

They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping based on sidereal year for solar cycle and adjustment of lunar cycles in every three years, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle and the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start. Of the various regional calendars, the most studied and known Hindu calendars are the Shalivahana Shaka (associated with the King Shalivahana and basis for the Indian national calendar) found in the Deccan region of Southern India and the Vikram Samvat (Bikrami) found in Nepal and the North and Central regions of India \u2013 both of which emphasize the lunar cycle. Their new year starts in spring. In regions such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the solar cycle is emphasized and this is called the Tamil calendar (though Tamil Calendar uses month names like in Hindu Calendar) and Malayalam calendar and these have origins in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. A Hindu calendar is sometimes referred to as Panchangam (\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0919\u094d\u0917\u092e\u094d), which is also known as Panjika in Eastern India.\nThe ancient Hindu calendar conceptual design is also found in the Babylonian calendar, the Chinese calendar, and the Hebrew calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to the month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and approximately 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but inserts an extra full month, once every 32\u201333 months, to ensure that the festivals and crop-related rituals fall in the appropriate season.\nThe Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since Vedic times, and rema"

In modern days, it is defined in China by GB/T 33661\u20132017, \"Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar\", issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.\n\n[Julian calendar]: Although most Eastern Orthodox countries (most of them in eastern or southeastern Europe) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \"Revised Julian calendar\" was endorsed by a synod in Constantinople in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated Easter astronomically at Jerusalem. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, with the exception of the Finnish Orthodox Church, which uses the Gregorian Paschalion.\n\n[Leap year]: For example, in the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an integer multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, which are not leap years unless evenly divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar Hebrew calendar, Adar Aleph, a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Calendar, a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the March equinox."

While the calendars share a common lineage, they also have minor but important variations such as intercalation schedules, month names and numbering, use of cycles, etc. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a year numbering system shared by the traditional Thai lunar calendar and by the Thai solar calendar.\nThe Southeast Asian lunisolar calendars are largely based on an older version of the Hindu calendar, which uses the sidereal year as the solar year. One major difference is that the Southeast Asian systems, unlike their Indian cousins, do not use apparent reckoning to stay in sync with the sidereal year. Instead, they employ their versions of the Metonic cycle. However, since the Metonic cycle is not very accurate for sidereal years, the Southeast Asian calendar is slowly drifting out of sync with the sidereal, approximately one day every 100 years. Yet no coordinated structural reforms of the lunisolar calendar have been undertaken.\nToday, the traditional Buddhist lunisolar calendar is used mainly for Theravada Buddhist festivals.

Because of the thirteen-day difference between the calendars between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in the Gregorian Calendar. Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian calendar (the Julian calendar is no longer used as the civil calendar of the countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate). Also, because the Julian \"full moon\" is always several days after the astronomical full moon, the eastern Easter is often later, relative to the visible Moon's phases, than western Easter.\n\n[Chinese calendar]: The traditional Chinese calendar (officially known as the Agricultural Calendar [\u8fb2\u66c6; \u519c\u5386; N\u00f3ngl\u00ec; 'farming calendar'], Former Calendar [\u820a\u66c6; \u65e7\u5386; Ji\u00f9l\u00ec], Traditional Calendar [\u8001\u66c6; \u8001\u5386; L\u01ceol\u00ec] or Lunar Calendar [\u9670\u66c6; \u9634\u5386; Y\u012bnl\u00ec; 'yin calendar']), is a lunisolar calendar which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena.

The most widely observed lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar. \nSince each lunation is approximately 29+1\u20442 days, it is common for the months of a lunar calendar to alternate between 29 and 30 days. Since the period of 12 such lunations, a lunar year, is 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes, 34 seconds (354.36707 days), lunar calendars are 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year. In lunar calendars, which do not make use of lunisolar calendars' intercalation, the lunar months cycle through all the seasons of a solar year over the course of a 33\u201334 lunar-year cycle (see, e.g., list of Islamic years). The details of when months begin vary from calendar to calendar, with some using new, full, or crescent moons and others employing detailed calculations. The term lunar new year is the first day of lunar calendar but, especially in the US, is widely used of lunisolar new years.\n\nPage: Blue Moon (spacecraft)\nSummary: Blue Moon is a family of lunar landers and their associated infrastructure, intended to carry humans and cargo to the Moon, under development by a consortium led by Blue Origin and including Lockheed Martin, Draper, Boeing, Astrobotic, and Honeybee Robotics. Two versions of Blue Moon are under development: a robotic lander originally planned to land on the Moon in 2024 and delayed to 2026, and a larger human lander planned to land a crew of four astronauts on the lunar surface for the NASA Artemis V mission in 2030.\nDevelopment of the smaller, uncrewed lander (Mark 1) began in 2016 and was publicly revealed in 2017. It is planned to be capable of delivering up to 3.0 tonnes (3."

The concept of \"month\" originally comes from lunar cycles (the time it takes for the Moon to complete its phases, approximately 29.5 days)\n2. Lunar calendars are based on the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months)\n3. Solar calendars (like the Gregorian calendar we use today) have months that do NOT correspond to cycles of the Moon phases\n4. The term \"month\" itself is derived from \"moon\" and originally referred to the lunar cycle\n\nHowever, in modern solar calendars like the Gregorian calendar, months are not based on the solar cycle but are arbitrary divisions of the solar year. The solar cycle refers to the 11-year cycle of solar activity, not to calendar months.\n\n**No**, months are not based on the solar cycle. The concept of months originated from lunar cycles, and while modern solar calendars use months as divisions of the solar year, they are not directly based on the solar cycle (which refers to the 11-year cycle of solar activity)."

The song, called Pig Latin Love, is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little Pigskins, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin. YouTube). The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all-time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. Merle Travis ends his song When My Baby Double Talks To Me with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\"."

Ostrich eggs are the largest of any bird, averaging 1.4 kg (3.1 lb).\nThe largest wingspan of any extant bird is that of the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) of the Sub-Antarctic oceans. The largest dimensions found in this species are an approximate head-to-tail length of 1.44 m (4.7 ft) and a wingspan of 3.65 m (12.0 ft).\nThe largest bird of all time was likely the elephant bird Aepyornis maximus, which was estimated to have weighed 275\u20131,000 kilograms (610\u20132,200 lb) and stood at 3 metres (9.8 ft) tall.\nThe largest wingspan of all time likely belonged to Pelagornis sandersi at roughly 5.2 m (17 ft). P. sandersi was also likely the largest bird to ever fly.\n\nPage: Dodo\nSummary: The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to Mauritius,  an island east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest relative was the also-extinct and flightless Rodrigues solitaire. The two formed the subtribe Raphina, a clade of extinct flightless birds that are a part of the group that includes pigeons and doves (the family Columbidae). The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of R\u00e9union, but it is now believed that this assumption was merely confusion based on the also-extinct R\u00e9union ibis and paintings of white dodos.\nSubfossil remains show the dodo measured about 62.6\u201375 centimetres (2.05\u20132.46 ft) in height and may have weighed 10.6\u201317.5 kg (23\u201339 lb) in the wild.

States have also allowed counties and municipalities to enact typically lower limits. Highway speed limits can range from an urban low of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) to a rural high of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). Speed limits are typically posted in increments of five miles per hour (8\u00a0km/h). Some states have lower limits for trucks and at night, and occasionally there are minimum speed limits.\n\n[Minor (law)]: In law, a minor is a person under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which legally demarcates childhood from adulthood. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is generally 18. Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the drinking age in the United States is usually 21, and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law, even if they are at least 18. The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority, but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit, such as the drinking age, smoking age, age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority.\n\n[Male]: A male (\u2642) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm. Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs."

This review discusses the evolution of cancer therapy over the past 20 years and attempts to assess their impact on fertility after treatment. Overall, cancer regimens have shifted from broadly killing fast dividing cells to more targeting therapies, reducing collateral damage in general. The mechanisms that explain this decline in male fertility over time are unclear, although the poorer quality of semen in those over 40 appears to be the main cause.A study shows that we can ingest between 37,000 and 90 ,000 microplastics a year using this type of disposable cup."

His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept. In a joint presentation with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped Robert Edmond Grant to investigate marine invertebrates. His studies at the University of Cambridge's Christ's College from 1828 to 1831 encouraged his passion for natural science. However, it was his five-year voyage on HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836 that truly established Darwin as an eminent geologist. The observations and theories he developed during his voyage supported Charles Lyell's concept of gradual geological change. Publication of his journal of the voyage made Darwin famous as a popular author. His first scientific work was The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs (1842). Along with his work on barnacles, it won him the Royal Medal in 1853.\nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and, in 1838, devised his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research, and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Wallace sent him an essay that described the same ide"

            "content": "[Charles Darwin]: Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.\n\n[Charles Darwin]: Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/; 12 February 1809\u00a0\u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.\n\n[On the Origin of Species]: On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation."

It is one of a few government agencies explicitly authorized by the Constitution of the United States. The USPS began operations in 1971, replacing the United States Post Office Department, a Cabinet department. As of March 29, 2024, the USPS has 525,377 career employees and nearly 114,623 pre-career employees.\nThe USPS has a monopoly on traditional letter delivery within the United States and operates under a universal service obligation (USO), both of which are defined across a broad set of legal mandates, which obligate it to provide uniform price and quality across the entirety of its service area. The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked \"U.S. Mail\" and personal letterboxes in the U.S., but has to compete against private package delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, and DHL.\n\nPage: Government shutdowns in the United States\nSummary: In the United States, a government shutdown, officially known as a lapse in appropriations, occurs when funding legislation required to finance the federal government is not enacted before the next fiscal year begins. During a shutdown, the federal government curtails agency activities and services, ceases non-essential operations, furloughs non-essential workers, and retains only essential employees in departments that protect human life or property. Shutdowns can also disrupt state, territorial, and local levels of government.\nFunding gaps have led to shutdowns since 1980, when Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion requiring it. This opinion was not consistently adhered to throughout the 1980s, but since 1990, all funding gaps last"

It is often celebrated to honor all those who served as presidents of the United States and, since 1879, has been the federal holiday honoring Founding Father George Washington, who led the Continental Army to victory in the American Revolutionary War, presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and served as the first U.S. president from 1789 to 1797.\nThe day is an official state holiday in most states under various names. Depending upon the specific law, the state holiday may officially celebrate Washington alone, Washington and Abraham Lincoln, or some other combination of U.S. presidents (such as Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who was born in April).\nGeorge Washington was born on February 22, 1732 (N.S.). Washington's Birthday was celebrated on this date from 1879 until 1970. To give federal employees a three-day weekend, in 1968 the Uniform Monday Holiday Act moved it to the third Monday in February, which can occur between February 15 and 21, starting in 1971. The day soon became known as Presidents(') Day (the presence and placement of the apostrophe varies) and provides an occasion to remember all the U.S. presidents, to honor Abraham Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays together, or any single president of choice.\nAs many states and cities followed suit, some states that had been celebrating Lincoln's birthday on February 12 combined the two into Presidents' Day. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, preserved the Union, abolished slavery, bolstered the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.\n\nPage: Federal holidays in the United States\nSummary: Federal holidays in the United States are 11 calendar dates designated by the U.S. federal government as holidays.

This blindness allows officers to more easily restrain subjects and permits people in danger to use pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. It also causes temporary discomfort and burning of the lungs which causes shortness of breath. Pepper spray is used as a less lethal weapon in policing, riot control, crowd control, and self-defense, including defense against dogs and bears.\nPepper spray was engineered originally for defense against bears, cougars, wolves, and other dangerous predators, and is often referred to colloquially as bear spray.\n\n"

It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It was hunted for its skin throughout its range up to the 1970s, and is threatened by illegal killing and habitat loss. It is regarded as dangerous to humans.\nThe saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile. Males can grow up to a weight of 1,000\u20131,500 kg (2,200\u20133,300 lb) and a length of 6 m (20 ft), rarely exceeding 6.3 m (21 ft). Females are much smaller and rarely surpass 3 m (9.8 ft). It is also called the estuarine crocodile, Indo-Pacific crocodile, marine crocodile, sea crocodile, and, informally, the saltie. A large and opportunistic hypercarnivorous apex predator, they ambush most of their prey and then drown or swallow it whole. They will prey on almost any animal that enters their territory, including other predators such as sharks, varieties of freshwater and saltwater fish including pelagic species, invertebrates such as crustaceans, various amphibians, other reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nPage: Freshwater crocodile\nSummary: The freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni), also known commonly as the Australian freshwater crocodile, Johnstone's crocodile, and the freshie, is a species of crocodile native to the northern regions of Australia. Unlike its much larger Australian relative, the saltwater crocodile, the freshwater crocodile is not known as a man-eater, although it bites in self-defence, and brief, nonfatal attacks have occurred, apparently the result of mistaken identity."

Performers such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Robert Wilkins, Joe McCoy, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie used a variety of unusual instruments such as washboard, fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. Memphis Minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. Pianist Memphis Slim began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement."

            "content": "Page: Coin wrapper\nSummary: A coin wrapper, also known as a bank roll or simply a roll, is a paper or plastic container designed to hold a specific number of coins. During 19th century, newly minted coins were collected in cloth bags. Initially, coin wrapping was a manual process. Since the onset of the 20th century, coin wrapping machines have been in use. The earliest patent for a coin wrapping machine was in 1901. By 1910, automatic coin counting machines were in use, which could reject counterfeit coins, wrap coins, and crimp the coin wrapper ends.\n\nPage: Coinage metals\nSummary: The coinage metals comprise those metallic chemical elements and alloys which have been used to mint coins. Historically, most coinage metals are from the three nonradioactive members of group 11 of the periodic table: copper, silver and gold. Copper is usually augmented with tin or other metals to form bronze. Gold, silver and bronze or copper were the principal coinage metals of the ancient world, the medieval period and into the late modern period when the diversity of coinage metals increased.  Coins are often made from more than one metal, either using alloys, coatings (cladding/plating) or bimetallic configurations.  While coins are primarily made from metal, some non-metallic materials have also been used.\n\n"

            "content": "[2 euro coin]: The 2 euro coin (\u20ac2) is the highest value euro coin and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002. The coin is used in 22 countries (with 20 legally adopting it) with a collective population of about 341\u00a0million. The coin is made of two alloys: the inner part of nickel brass, the outer part of copper-nickel. All coins have a common reverse side and country-specific national sides. The coin has been used since 2002, with the present common side design dating from 2007.\n\n[Density]: To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.\n\n[One pound (British coin)]: The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current \u00a32 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \"iSIS\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems)."

Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\n\n[Coin]: Coins are usually metal or an alloy, or sometimes made of manmade materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulation coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law)."
