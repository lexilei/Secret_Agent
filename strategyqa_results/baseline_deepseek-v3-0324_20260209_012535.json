      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the question: \"Does 2015 have more unlucky Friday's than usual?\"\n\nFirst, \"unlucky Friday\" typically refers to Friday the 13th. So, we need to determine if 2015 has more occurrences of Friday the 13th than an average year.\n\nA common year has 365 days (not leap year), which is 52 weeks and 1 day. This extra day causes the days of the week to shift forward by one each year (or two in a leap year). The occurrence of Friday the 13th depends on the starting day of the year and whether it's a leap year.\n\n2015 is not a leap year (since 2015 is not divisible by 4). It started on a Thursday (you can recall or calculate: January 1, 2015 was a Thursday).\n\nNow, to find Friday the 13ths:\n- January 13, 2015: January 1 was Thursday, so January 13 is Thursday + 12 days = Tuesday? Wait, better to calculate:\n  Jan 1: Thursday\n  Jan 8: Thursday\n  Jan 13: Thursday + 5 days = Tuesday? Actually, from Jan 1 to Jan 13 is 12 days later. 12 mod 7 = 5. Thursday + 5 = Tuesday. So not Friday.\n\n- February 13: January has 31 days, so Feb 1 is Thursday + 31 mod 7 = Thursday + 3 = Sunday. Then Feb 13 is Sunday + 12 days, 12 mod 7=5, Sunday+5=Friday. So February 13 is Friday.\n\n- March 13: February has 28 days (not leap), so March 1 is Sunday (Feb 1) + 28 mod 7=0, so still Sunday. March 13 is Sunday + 12 days, 12 mod 7=5, so Friday.\n\n- April 13: March has 31 days, so April 1 is Sunday + 31 mod 7=3, so Wednesday. April 13 is Wednesday + 12 days, 12 mod 7=5, so Monday? Wait, Wednesday+5=Monday? Actually, Wednesday + 12 days: 12/7=1 week 5 days, so Wednesday+5=Monday. Not Friday.\n\n- Similarly, we can continue, but we already have two: February and March.\n\nIn fact, for a common year starting on Thursday, the Friday the 13ths are in February, March, and November. So there are three in 2015.\n\nHow many is usual? On average, there are 1.72 Friday the 13ths per year, but they occur in cycles. Typically, a year can have 1, 2, or 3 such days. Having three is the maximum and occurs more rarely than 1 or 2.\n\nSo, 2015 has three Friday the 13ths (February, March, November), which is more than the average of about 1.72.\n\nTherefore, yes, 2015 has more unlucky Fridays than usual.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{\\text{yes}}",

      "raw_response": "To answer the question: \"Were there fifty English kings throughout the Middle Ages?\" let's break it down:\n\n1. **Define the Middle Ages**: Typically, the Middle Ages in England are considered to span from 1066 (Norman Conquest) to 1485 (end of the Wars of the Roses and beginning of the Tudor dynasty). Some might start earlier, but the Norman Conquest is a common starting point for medieval England.\n\n2. **List the English kings during this period**:\n   - **Norman Kings (1066-1154)**:\n     1. William I (1066-1087)\n     2. William II (1087-1100)\n     3. Henry I (1100-1135)\n     4. Stephen (1135-1154) [and Matilda, though not crowned queen]\n   - **Angevin/Plantagenet Kings (1154-1485)**:\n     5. Henry II (1154-1189)\n     6. Richard I (1189-1199)\n     7. John (1199-1216)\n     8. Henry III (1216-1272)\n     9. Edward I (1272-1307)\n     10. Edward II (1307-1327)\n     11. Edward III (1327-1377)\n     12. Richard II (1377-1399)\n     13. Henry IV (1399-1413)\n     14. Henry V (1413-1422)\n     15. Henry VI (1422-1461, 1470-1471)\n     16. Edward IV (1461-1470, 1471-1483)\n     17. Edward V (1483, uncrowned)\n     18. Richard III (1483-1485)\n\n3. **Count the kings**: From William I to Richard III, there are 18 kings (including Edward V, who was not crowned but is traditionally counted). If we consider the entire medieval period from 1066 to 1485, that's 18 monarchs.\n\n4. **Comparison to fifty**: The number 50 is much higher. Even if we include earlier Anglo-Saxon kings (before 1066), the total number of English kings from all eras is around 66 (from Egbert in 802 to Elizabeth II, but that includes post-medieval). Specifically for the Middle Ages (say from Alfred the Great in 871 to Richard III in 1485), there were about 25-30 kings, still far fewer than 50.\n\n**Conclusion**: There were not fifty English kings throughout the Middle Ages. The actual number is significantly less.\n\n**Answer**: No.",

Carmine's restaurant is likely a reference to an Italian restaurant, as \"Carmine\" is an Italian name and basil is a key herb in Italian cuisine (e.g., in pesto, caprese salad, and many pasta dishes). However, the question doesn't provide specific details about the chef or the restaurant's menu.\n\nThe key point is whether the absence of basil would cause panic. Panic implies a severe, disruptive reaction. While basil is important, a professional chef would typically have contingency plans, such as substituting with other herbs (e.g., oregano, parsley) or adjusting the menu. Therefore, it's unlikely that a skilled chef would panic over a single missing ingredient.\n\nThus, the answer should be no.\n\nAnswer: No.",

      "raw_response": "Based on available evidence and research, yes, Chinese Americans have faced and continue to face discrimination at the federal level in the US, though it is often complex, systemic, and can be traced through historical and contemporary policies and actions.\n\nKey evidence supporting this includes:\n\n*   **Historical Legislation:** Laws like the **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882** were explicitly discriminatory federal policies that banned Chinese laborers from immigrating and prevented those already in the US from becoming citizens. This was the first and only major federal law to explicitly suspend immigration for a specific nationality.\n*   **Modern-Day Scrutiny Programs:** Initiatives like the **China Initiative**, launched by the US Department of Justice in 2018, were widely criticized for fueling racial profiling against scientists, researchers, and academics of Chinese descent. While the program was formally terminated in 2022 due to these concerns, its legacy and the \"chilling effect\" it created persist.\n*   **Heightened Scrutiny and Visa Policies:** Chinese students and scholars, particularly in STEM fields, often face heightened scrutiny and delays in visa processing due to federal policies aimed at preventing intellectual property theft. While the target is the Chinese government, the implementation frequently disproportionately affects individuals of Chinese origin, leading to concerns about discrimination based on national origin.\n*   **Hate Crimes and Federal Response:** A rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, often fueled by rhetoric linking people of Asian descent to the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted the federal government to pass the **COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act** in 2021. The very need for this legislation underscores the prevalence of discrimination, including against Chinese Americans, and represents a federal acknowledgment of the problem.\n\nTherefore, while the most overtly racist federal laws are historical, contemporary federal actions and policies, even those with legitimate national security aims, have been documented to have a discriminatory impact on Chinese Americans.",

Males can regularly reach lengths of over 6 meters (20 feet) and weigh well over 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs). An alligator, even a large male, is significantly smaller, maxing out at around 4-4.5 meters (13-15 feet) and 450 kg (1,000 lbs). The saltwater croc has a much more powerful bite force.\n*   **Temperament:** Saltwater crocodiles are notoriously aggressive and territorial. They are hyper-carnivorous apex predators known for attacking almost anything that enters their domain. Alligators are generally more cautious and less aggressive toward large creatures they perceive as a threat.\n*   **Habitat (Lake Urmia):** While Lake Urmia is a saltwater lake, this factor is negligible. The American alligator has special glands to expel salt and can tolerate brackish water for periods. However, the saltwater crocodile is supremely adapted to both fresh and saltwater environments, so it would have no disadvantage. The habitat does not tip the scales in the alligator's favor.\n\nIn a direct confrontation, the saltwater crocodile's immense size, power, and ferocity would overwhelmingly dominate the smaller, less aggressive alligator.",

      "raw_response": "Let's break down the question: \"Will speed reader devour The Great Gatsby before the Raven?\"\n\nThis seems to be a play on words or a riddle. \"The Great Gatsby\" is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and \"the Raven\" likely refers to the poem by Edgar Allan Poe. \"Devour\" here probably means to read quickly or voraciously.\n\nHowever, the key is in the phrasing: \"speed reader\" might be interpreted literally as someone who reads fast, but it could also be a pun. \"Speed reader\" sounds like \"speed reader,\" but if we think about it, \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"the Raven\" are both literary works. But note: \"the Raven\" is a short poem, while \"The Great Gatsby\" is a novel. A speed reader would typically finish the shorter work first.\n\nBut let's consider the word \"devour\" \u2013 it means to eat hungrily. So, if we think metaphorically, \"devour\" might imply consuming the content. However, there's a twist: \"Gatsby\" sounds like \"cats by\" and \"Raven\" is a bird. So, \"speed reader\" might be misheard as \"speed reader\" but could be \"speed reaper\" or something else? Actually, it might be \"speed reader\" as in one who reads quickly.\n\nBut wait: \"devour\" means to eat. So, if a speed reader (fast reader) is going to devour (eat) The Great Gatsby (which sounds like \"cats by\") before the Raven (the bird). This seems like a pun or a joke.\n\nPerhaps it's a reference to the fact that a raven is a bird that might be eaten by a cat? But Gatsby isn't a cat; it's a name.\n\nAnother angle: \"Gatsby\" might be heard as \"cats be\" or \"cat's by\", and \"raven\" is the bird. So, \"devour The Great Gatsby\" could be misheard as \"devour the cats by\" and \"before the Raven\" \u2013 meaning that the cats are devoured before the raven? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it's a literal question: will a speed reader finish reading the novel \"The Great Gatsby\" before finishing the poem \"The Raven\"? Obviously, \"The Raven\" is much shorter, so the speed reader would finish \"The Raven\" first. Therefore, they would NOT devour (read) Gatsby before the Raven; they would read the Raven first.\n\nSo, the answer should be no.\n\nTo confirm: a speed reader can read \"The Raven\" (a poem of about 1,000 words) in a few seconds, while \"The Great Gatsby\" (about 50,000 words) would take at least a few minutes even for a speed reader. So, they would definitely finish \"The Raven\" before \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nTherefore, the speed reader will not devour The Great Gatsby before the Raven; they will devour the Raven first.\n\nAnswer: no.\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{no}}",

In mainstream Hindu theology and the primary texts, Hanuman is celebrated as a *brahmachari* (celibate), and his divine nature is often associated with purity and unwavering devotion to Lord Rama, with no mention of sensual experiences.\n\nThus, while some lesser-known stories suggest an event that might be interpreted as an orgasm, it is not part of the canonical or widely accepted narrative.

James survived the plot, and his descendants continued to rule, meaning Mary's bloodline persisted through the Stuart dynasty and beyond.",
